English Station burned coal until 1960, and subsequently switched to residual fuel oil. In 1974, UI built Harbor Station in the East Shore, converting English station into a “peaking unit,” a station used only during times of peak demand. It was placed on “deactivated reserve” in 1992 due to the cost inefficiency of producing electricity on the site. Because of an energy-restructuring act, UI was required to sell off all its energy assets and transferred ownership of the plant in 2000 to Quinnipiac Energy, a move that cost UI $4.25 million (New Haven Independent, 2009). The ownership of the power plant would change hands again, this time to Evergreen Power LLC. Evergreen hired Grant McKaye, a Utah-based industrial demolition company, to knock down the building by early 2012. However, carcinogens known as PCBs discovered in the oil produced by English Station caused plans for the plant’s demolition to be placed on hold, and scrutiny to be placed on the plant itself.  Regulators asserted that Evergreen’s current salvage operations could be releasing even more hazardous material on the site, which then led to the company falling out with Grant McKaye Co., who realized that the company might not get permission to dismantle the plant due to legal and environmental concerns. Robert Smuts, a city spokesman at the time, outlined New Haven’s priorities regarding the site: “first and foremost to make sure there is no active health or other public safety issue with the site, Two, making sure there isn’t a mess an LLC goes off and walks away from, leaving the city with a million dollar price tag. Third, finding a productive reuse of the property” (New Haven Independent, 2011). While Smuts assured that the city was being actively involved in the cleanup, the presence of harmful substances on the property may complicate the situation. Due to the presence of both asbestos and carcinogens, demolition of the site would be a complicated and costly process and may run the risk of releasing more hazardous materials. Indeed, Smuts and other officials conceded that the most environmentally safe course of action for the building may be to leave it as is, perhaps a cold comfort to Fair Haven and Wooster Square residents who will feel first-hand the effects of the plant’s pollutants. Additionally, several New Haven community groups are also pushing against the demolition of the building due to its “eye-catching” nature and its history as a local landmark. The Urban Design League asserts, “the architectural firm of Wescott and Mapes designed the power plant in the 1920s to ‘appeal to the eye as well as the cash box,’” and other groups have argued for its preservation as a historical landmark (New Haven Independent, 2011). An administrative order issued by DEEP and Attorney General George Jepsen in April 2013 cited the presence of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), heavy metals, and other harmful substances on the site of the power plant. The order was issued to the plant’s current owners, Asnat Realty of New York and Wilmington, Md.-based Evergreen Power, as well as Grant MacKay Demolition Co., and its original owner, U.I. (New Haven Register, 2013). As of 2013, U.I. claimed that they are not responsible for the cleanup of the plant, due to the fact that they have not owned it in thirteen years. However, the current owners assert that U.I. does still share some of the burden, an assessment that is shared with some local and state officials (New Haven Independent, 2009). Controversy also surrounded the plant’s original owner, United Illuminating Company, when it announced that it was moving its headquarters out of New Haven to Orange, CT. Activists and state officials alike admonished the company for its failure to clean up English Station, U.I. may in fact retain some liability for the plant it ran for 62 years, if its current owners fail to clean up the site (New Haven Independent, 2011). New Haven Mayor John DeStefano expressed concern regarding the station’s current status, asserting, "stalling on cleaning up English Station is perplexing, as potential health risks to humans and environmental risks to the harbor only increase with the passage of time." (New Haven Register, 2013). English Station is currently regarded as “in limbo,” with political, environmental, and architectural concerns in conflict over what the best course of action is for the deteriorating local landmark and the hazardous chemicals it harbors.

In June of 1946, Saint Thomas Episcopal Church, a Victorian Gothic landmark, was sold for $100,000 to the First Federal Savings and Loan Association as part of the New Haven bank’s expansion plan. The transaction included both the original brownstone church building and the adjacent rectory, both built in 1855.

Prominent New Haven architect Roy W. Foote, known locally for his work at West Haven High School and the Southern New England Telephone Company Building, was hired for the preliminary planning stages. His vision, much like the commercial Art Deco buildings of that time, called for a streamlined façade, handsomely polished sandstone, and large reflective glass windows. With very little changes made since its construction in 1948, the bank stands today as a two-story masonry structure, with 10 bays abutting the street front and a flat roof. The bays are sheathed in sandstone blocks with vertical windows in metal frames. A central pavilion of polished granite asymmetrically divides the bays, and its double doors exist as the main entrance to the building.

Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the building, however, is Foote’s decision to maintain the skeletal frame of the Saint Thomas Episcopal – preserving both the central nave and balcony. The original pitched roof of the church can still be seen from the street, and the balcony is visible from the structure’s interior attic. As a result of this shift in program, the interior of the bank still very much resembles the typical layout of a Gothic church – what was the aisle remains the central circulation axis for customers and the bank tenants’ cubicles exist where the pews once were, facing inward toward the aisle. A second floor mezzanine level exists for offices, in what one can imagine was once the church’s clerestory.

The bank’s name was changed to Webster Bank in the late 1980’s when the company changed ownership.','','1948','Roy Foote','','80 Elm Street','41.307549','[{\'filename\': \'80Elm.image015-2827972373.jpg\', \'_id\': ObjectId(\'5908f5f41b570b1ffc3ed80d\'), \'caption\': \'Webster Bank in 2011 (photo:  Sarah Brown)\'}, {\'filename\': \'80Elm.image017-811191154.jpg\', \'_id\': ObjectId(\'5908f5f41b570b1ffc3ed80c\'), \'caption\': \'Entrance to Webster Bank (photo:  Sarah Brown, 2011)\'}, {\'filename\': \'80Elm.image019-2649313922.jpg\', \'_id\': ObjectId(\'5908f5f41b570b1ffc3ed80b\'), \'caption\': \'(Photo:  Sarah Brown, 2011)\'}, {\'filename\': \'80Elm.image013-3217359560.png\', \'_id\': ObjectId(\'5908f5f41b570b1ffc3ed80a\'), \'caption\': \'Sanborn Fire Insurance map, 1973, of the First Federal Savings and Loan building.

As of 2015, the building is occupied by Kiko Milano, a cosmetic brand from Italy, and Emporium DNA 2050, a high end retailer.

The site can be earliest traced to 1913, when Broadway was a bustling commercial strip, and the corner of Broadway and York was home to a collection of commercial buildings (Mills Brown 1976).  At the turn of the century, Simon Persky, a local real estate developer, owned Numbers 1-13 Broadway and leased out the spaces to various shopkeepers.  Ralph Pagter leased Number 1 Broadway, the storefront on the corner, for twenty years, from 1904 through 1924, and operated a clothing store there.  Even when Persky leased the entire collection of buildings to the Charles S. Longley Company in 1924, Pagter continued to rent the second and third floors and cellar of the building from Longley until at least 1931 (Historic Resources Inventory 1981; White Brothers &amp; Clark, Hall &amp; Peck 1931).  Pagter’s clothing shop was a mainstay on the corner, a longstanding retail anchor with sandwiched among other shops.

Persky retained his properties through the Depression, but by 1939, 1 Broadway was no longer a retail hub.  Instead, the corner now hosted the College Toasty Restaurant, operated directly by Charles S. Longley himself, with a clothing shop now located next door (the Yale Clothing Center &amp; Rental Parlor at Number 3).  But the Depression had taken its toll, and many of the other storefronts on the block were vacant.  In 1943, a fire destroyed all of Persky’s buildings at 1-13 Broadway. Rather than rebuild three-story small-lot buildings, he decided to take the block in a modernist direction.  In 1944, Persky secured a permit to build a one-story building that would encompass the entire collection of properties: 1-13 Broadway would now simply be 1 Broadway.  The V-shaped brick building, wrapping around the corner of Broadway and York and extending down the street, was unlike anything else the area had to offer.  When historic preservationists surveyed the building in 1981, they explained, “While not particularly well-integrated with the scale, cornice line and style of surrounding Broadway and York Street, this building exemplifies in New Haven an economically-designed small commercial structure of the 1940s which combines aspects of Art Deco… and Art Moderne… Its style is unique in the sector” (Historic Resources Inventory 1981; New Haven City Directory 1939).

The Liggett Drug Company became the block’s next mainstay, remaining on the site for at least twenty years.  Another pharmacy, Morton’s, succeeded Liggett’s in the 1970s, making the corner of Broadway and York the site of a locally owned neighborhood pharmacy for over thirty years (New Haven City Directory 1947, 1967, 1974).  By 1980, the building was vacant, and in 1981 Stan Lessler, a local attorney, rented the large space from Gertrude Levin and Martin H. Mult to revive the spirit of the old College Toasty and give the building a try as an eatery once more.  The café would seat 140, and although no cooking would be permitted on site, sandwiches, newspapers, and cookies would be available for purchase.  In 1983, the operators added an ice cream parlor (Building Permit Application 1981a,b; Building Permit 1983).  Called Crumbs, by the 1990s the establishment had been renamed Demery’s (New Haven City Directory 1994).

In 1995, Yale University took control of the building and transformed it into Au Bon Pain, a café that became one of the harbingers of the university’s transformation of Broadway into a high-end shopping district dominated by university-sponsored national chains.  With only a 50-seat capacity, the space transitioned quickly from a large eatery with room for many diners to a quick in-and-out establishment.  Au Bon Pain left the space in 2013, and Yale University Properties spent one year looking for new tenants "to add it its list of retail and restaurant properties" (New Haven Register.)

Tracing the changing use of 1 Broadway indicates the somewhat surprising repetition of uses over time.  Beginning as a clothing store, the original building was owned and operated by the same people for dozens of years until fire prompted radical changes.  The new building enjoyed a long second life as a drug store before being transformed once again into a café, a use that has survived for thirty years. Today, the building is once again a clothing store, bringing it back to its original program.

Despite these few sustained uses, however, the building’s role in the community has changed drastically over time.  As a centrally located drug store, for instance, 1 Broadway was able to serve a broad swath of the community, and the 140-seat café (which was not owned by the university) could provide a setting in which city residents could sit, linger, and meet others.  The current 50-seat Au Bon Pain, by contrast, provides a quick in-and-out environment; its prices are too high for a large number of New Haven residents; and the university’s ownership of the space and of the rest of Broadway has converted the area into an extension of the campus.  Au Bon Pain is a university-controlled space, and it feels like one; subjectively, it does not feel open to non-Yale affiliated residents.

Temple Court, refers to the complex of three-floor and single unit condominium residences that are at the center of the complex, while Whitney-Grove Square is the name used to refer to the entire development. This investigation focuses on the development from the Temple Street side, and looks into the integration of the brown stone style new condominiums with the older brownstones still standing on the street. On September 22. 1784. the City of New Haven formally named Temple Street, delineating its location and marking its width at fifty feet. At that time, the street had no buildings on it, running as it did through the estates of several prominent New Haven citizens. Over the next eighty- five years, the street slowly grew. At points along the way, as in 1862, the numbering along the street was changed to allow for more buildings. Then, in 1870, the first major documented construction occurred. Nelson C. Newgeon erected six brick rowhouses, all in the same style. at numbers 387- 395 Temple Street. According to documents in the White Brothers\' Files at Sterling Memorial Library Manuscripts and Archives, Newgeon sold each of these houses to its original owner between the years o f 1871 and 1874. The houses remained privately owned, single-family homes until the early 20\' century, when they became dormitory housing for the Sheffield Science School. A part o f Yale College, the Sheff\' School, as it was familiarly known, housed those students interested in the sciences. A 1925 directory suggests that numbers 393-397 arc Mrs. Beda Skousgaard\'s Boarding House-this information seems to contradict what is above, although only in the case of two of the dwelling units. It is possible that in one or the other location, the numbering is mistaken, or else that Mrs Skousgaard was related to Yale and ran the Sheff School dormitories.

At that same time, the buildings surrounding these six begin to see a more mixed use. While the block had been primarily residences with some light industry on the corner previously, by it boasted the Elm City Flower Shop at number 383, and Sheff Shoppe Lunch at number 381. These commercial establishments sprung up in response to, and in service of, the Sheff School students living on the block. In 1935, the next major change on the street takes place. Numbers 387-395 are sold to Yale in this rear. The next year, Yale demolishes a USl dwelling to make way for a ground level parking lot. This plot of land remains in Yale\'s hands and as a functioning parking lot, occasionally including a gas station, until the development which brings it to its present day incarnation. In 1979. the realtor H. Pearce and Yale University began consideration of redevelopment of the Whitney-Grove area. Four years later in 1983, the official proposal was for a Planned Development District in that area [0 be called \'\'Whitney-Grove Square. The key players in the development project were Herbert S. Newman, the architects, and H. Pearce and Carley Capital Group who were co-developers. Their proposal recommended creating a mixed use district out of the 2.5 acre site that would include residential, office, and retail spaces, as well as a parking lot. And indeed the final development did include all of these pieces. The parking lot sits under the residences of Temple Court on the Temple Street side, while retail sits on the bottom floors of the residences that from Whitney and the office building on the corner of Whitney and Grove. The residences themselves consist of 27 full townhouse units and 16 flats. In the written proposal, both the economic and aesthetic benefits of the project are highlighted. The proposal claims that the development with favorable assist with the creation of the Audobon Arts district, and that it will in a profit of $255,000 annually. The proposal notes that me townhouses are developed in two sections, the first being those intended fill the gap in the Temple Street facade, the second being those in an interior court. The proposal notes that the architectural detailing with make an effort to fit in style and elegance with the 1870s era townhouses that remain along Temple Street. It says the Temple Street townhouses will continue the fine masonry material, window and door detailing across me site. From visiting the site. I would agree with the developers assessment that the development assists in the creation of a unified Audobon Arts district. This is true in large part because Herbert Newman is the architect responsible for both developments, so there is a strong continuity.

I do not, however, believe that either the window or door detailing matches with the older townhouses-far from it. Indeed it is the windows that, for me, cause this development to fail from an aesthetic perspective, and to fail in the creation of a truly individualized, residential feeling. The windows are all square or close to square, and consists of single large panes of glass, with the exception square windows made up of four smaller square panes of glass. More than anything, if is the dimensioning of these windows that makes them feel our of place on a residential building. These square windows that show up on the residences are the same as those on the office building at the comer of Whitney and Grove. Because one can see the office building from the interior of Temple Court, it is impossible not to notice this relationship, and impossible therefore not to be constantly aware that the Temple Court dwellings are part of a larger, essentially corporate development. In concert with the entryway porticoes, which reference the porticoes of the older townhouses but have a similarly corporate and mass-produced feel and the stair railings, which lack the hand-wrought and decorated feel of older railings, the windows cause Temple Court to feel like just another development rather than like a unique home setting. Despite its aesthetic shortcomings, Temple Court provides dwellings well suited to the needs of its residents.

From 1947 until 1955 little is known about the fate of the two-story residence, but one can assume it fell into disrepair with no owner. A 1949 survey sites that the “USA occupies locus as a recruiting station”. Whatever the cause, the building was demolished to make way for its current occupant.

In 1955 the Duchess Diner was built by Harold and Jack Berkowitz. The Berkowitz family continues to own a local chain of Duchess Restaurants. The diner itself was manufactured by The Mountain View Diners Company in Singac, NJ. Founded in 1939, one source cites the comp...any as a “very aggressive marketer in the early 1950\'s, shipping diners to buyers all over the country. Their trademark was a unique corner detail known as the "cowcatcher". The corner detail of the diner remains intact, but the company closed in 1957.

Between 1977 and1980 Ross Proctor takes over the Duchess. In Diners of New England Randy Garbin describes Proctor’s attempt to “fashion the 1955 Mountain View after the diner-as-bistro precedent established by Manhattan’s Empire Diner in 1976. In that case, Jack Doenias took a run-down midtown diner in a depressed neighborhood and introduced haute cuisine. The irony struck chords in both the New York art and restaurant scenes, with repercussion throughout the country. Proctor attempted something similar with the Elm City, introducing subdued mood lighting, a dress code, a baby grand piano, and gourmet menu items. Customers sipped fine wines while listening to live jazz. But unlike the Empire diner, here the concept didn’t take.” Between 1993 and 1997 The Tandoor took over the diner and currently serves Indian cuisine a unique location making view permanent alterations to the historic diner.','[]','','1955','[\'Chapel West\']','[]','','','1226 Chapel Street, New Haven, CT','41.3091221','','[\'Westward through Dwight Edgewood\']','None');

For many residents of the Wooster Square neighborhood, Ferraro’s Market is a community center packed on the weekends with families buying groceries for the week ahead. The street is reminiscent of the neighborhood’s early 19th century immigration, sprinkled with old-fashioned mom-and-pop Italian bakeries and Polish delis. Ferraro’s is one such family-oriented business. Featuring an impressive meat selection, selves of fresh produce, and a unique history, the Ferraro name has been a New Haven staple even before the market was established at its current location.

Ferraro’s Market started out in 1953 as Mohawk Market, originally located on 406 State Street. Salvatore Ferraro co-owned and ran the meat counter at Mohawk before investing in the Grand Avenue property that would become Ferraro’s Market in 1973. In the 50’s, several grocery stores opened on State Street. However, the early 60’s brought changes in the family dynamic that, in turn, called for a change in the way businesses are run. As more and more stay-at-home mothers joined the workforce, small stores with limited selections became inconvenient. Residents no longer had the time to carefully peruse through the shelves of novelty items on their shopping trips; instead, they opted for larger, more impersonal supermarkets that contained all of their needs in one place. In order to counter the loss of local business to larger chains, two other State Street tenants—Rosner’s Market (382-386 State St) and Gambardella Brothers (400 State St)—merged with Mohawk Market in 1968 to create a larger, more convenient supermarket that still provided the personalized service inherent to smaller shops. Rosner’s rare specialty goods, Gambardella’s fresh produce, and Mohawk’s famous meat counter would together catch the attention of the shifting market.

Salvatore Ferraro, Anthony Gambardella, and Irwin Rosner were optimistic about their new joint venture. They invested $10,000 in constructing a parking lot to accommodate the growing number of family-owned cars in New Haven as decentralization moved families further from the commercial strip. When asked about whether urban renewal will take him out of State Street, Ferraro (now ironically) promised: “Oh, no, we’ll stay here. We might move into a newer store, maybe across the street, but we’ll still be here on State Street, all of us, where our customers will easily be able to find us.” The now-defunct Rosner’s and Gambardella stores on State Street were torn down as part of the State Street Redevelopment Project in the late 60’s.

Only four years later, Salvatore Ferraro left Mohawk Market to pursue a solo project on Grand Avenue. The current Ferraro’s Market property was built as part of the Wooster Square Project to rejuvenate the stagnating neighborhood. To combat the proposal of building I-91 straight through the commercial center, the New Haven Redevelopment Agency seized deteriorating properties along Grand Avenue, displacing businesses and constructing newer buildings to eliminate blight. One such seized property was 686 Grand Avenue, home to a grocery store called Rosner’s Cash and Carry in the 50’s and Rosner’s Grand in the 60’s. This shop was also owned by Irwin Rosner, the same businessman who partnered with Ferraro and Gambardella to form Mohawk Market.

Rosner’s inability to rebuild parts of the building that were clearly in dire need of maintenance forced the Redevelopment Agency to claim the property in the late  60’s. The Redevelopment Agency approved Mohawk Market’s plans to transition onto Grand Avenue in 1972. The land was sold for one dollar per square foot. A true family affair, the new Ferraro’s Market was represented by Ferraro Reality Corporation and the new contractor was Ferraro Contractor Corporation. They hired architects from Carlin and Pozzi Architects, P.C. to design a new building that was completed and opened in 1973. The original Mohawk Market location on State Street was taken over by the Southern New England Telephone Company as office and equipment space.

In 1984, Ferraro experienced its first renovation, which added a one-story brick addition to existing store for the expansion of a work and sales room. In 1990, Ferraro’s erected a one-story masonry addition to the rear of the building for a workroom and for storage. In 1993, contractor Joseph and Phillip Ferraro of Ferraro Enterprise Inc. constructed new footing and foundations. They also expanded upwards with a two-story masonry addition. They maintained the fire separation, exit sign, emergency light, and fire alarm system. All the new features are handicap accessible.

The modern Ferraro’s Market still features an open porch area as the building’s entrance, as well as the two-story attached office area for the market’s internal affairs and storage. As the car was and still is the most common form of transportation in the area, Ferraro’s has owned a 40,000-square-foot private parking space since its early days on Grand Avenue, paved in the adjacent vacant lots that once held Rosner’s Grand. After owner Salvatore Ferraro died in 2012, his son Peter took over the family business and has been running the supermarket ever since.

McCusker','[]','[]','[]','[]','','','Now a vacant retail space for lease and owned by a Greenwich, CT-based firm called One Church Street, LLC, 31 Church Street has long been utilized by businesses in New Haven.  The current façade is quite indicative of its varied history; a for-lease sign covers the sign over the space on the righthand side of the structure, while the Western Union office on the left side is plastered with signs notifying customers of its move to another location.  The whitewashed side wall looks like it’s been repainted numerous times.  This, it seems, has always been a building in transition.

The first record of the property comes in 1829 under the name of Timothy Beers, who owned much of the surrounding land as well.  Upon his death in 1858, he bequeathed all of it to his various children and their children, according to his will as found in Sterling’s Manuscripts and Archives.  Old photographs reveal that the property used to hold a bookstore (Figure 1) before this current building was erected in 1900.  Research indicates that it was not finally completed until 1907, at which time John P. McCusker, Elmer F. Schroeder, and Harry Levy bought it.  Despite the frequent change in leasers, these three and their heirs dominate the ownership of the building through more than half of the twentieth century until Yale assumed the mortgage in 1955.  McCusker, Schroeder, and Levy owned and operated a coal and wood business, and for many years occupied one part of the building.  City directories reveal other tenants included a jewelry shop (A.M. Paul), Oriental restaurant (Yong Min, manager), various clothiers (Wilton’s Clothiers, Smith and Barrett, Inc.), and more.  For a time, Sylvester Poli, a successful vaudeville theater entrepreneur, owned and operated a theater next door while Amusement Palace, Inc. operated a billiards room in 31 Church.  One can imagine the street being a social hub for Yale and New Haven in the middle of the twentieth century.  However, after speaking with the building’s realtor, Mr. Ed Schwartz, I learned that in recent memory the most common landmark there was a retail site for Congress Pants, Inc.  A friend of Mr. Schwartz’s had owned a clothing shop in New Haven for 35 years and did not remember anything but Congress Pants in that location.  The Appraisal Direct web site says Congress Pants sold the property to One Church Street, LLC in 1992.

The structure and land are currently appraised at a total of $481,250.  According to information acquired from the New Haven Building Records Office, many of the tenants, ranging from McCusker, Schroeder, &amp; Levy in the early twentieth century to A&amp;J Realty in 1957, altered the storefront to shape it into what it is today (Figure 2).  Like clockwork, new tenants put in walls, altered the storefront, and hung new signs.  However, much of what McCusker and company did remains, including the plate glass window fronts and what was described as “modernistic store front alterations.”  Fire damage in the 1940s is evident, as twice tenant Thomas Muller took out a permit with the city to repair fire damage, costing him a total of $14,000.  Through all of this, the theme seems to be the permanence of 31 Church through the transience of renters and environments.  One particularly poignant example of this was the Great Depression.  In 1929, jeweler Abram M Paul signed a lease for $5000 per year.  In 1931, he declared bankruptcy.  Within that time, rent had fallen to $500 per year for the building’s tenants.  This is one example of many relating to how 31 Church has survived the phenomena that have swept through New Haven in the course of the city’s rich history.','[]','','1900','[]','[]','Unknown Architect','','31 Church Street, New Haven, CT 06510','41.3038996','','[\'Preservation & Renewal towards Trowbridge Square\']','None');

They were a family of merchants and tailors who contributed to the establishment of a commercial district along Chapel Street early in New Haven’s history. Prior to building the structure that still stands on the corner of Chapel and College streets, the Townsend family operated a merchant tailor business at this site in 1794. Throughout the 1800s, the building housed the Townsend tailors and their various business partners. Around 1857, New Haven House (the Taft Hotel’s precursor) used the top three floors of the building as an annex to their main facilities across the street.

After the turn of the century, the building was no longer owned by the Townsend family. The first floor remained commercial – gift shops, candy shops, and a Fenmore Hat Store occupied the street level. The top floors alternated between residences (the Greenview Apartments in 1923) and hotel use (the Lincoln Hotel in 1945). In September of 1975, Claire and Frank Criscuolo took over the first floor of the building and opened Claire’s Corner Copia, a vegetarian/vegan restaurant that continues to be extremely successful. In 2004, Yale University purchased the building from the Chapel Company (who had purchased the building from Bertrand Weisbart, the previous owner). The top three floors then became known as The Townsend Apartments, exclusively available for rent to faculty, staff, and students of Yale University.

The Townsends built the structure in Greek Revival style, with a wood frame and a brick exterior. Cut stone and wood detailing adorn the hip roof and bay windows on the top 3 floors. The street level facade has been modified several times but the rest of the building has remained essentially structurally the same as it was in the early 1800s.','[]','','1830','[\'Chapel Street\']','[]','Unknown','','1000 Chapel Street, New Haven CT','41.3072011','','[\'Touring Chapel, Crown & High\']','None');

At that point the building transferred ownership to Tyco Printing and Publishing. TodayYale University Properties owns it. In 1926, Simon Persky obtained the properties on Broadway with mortgages from the First National Bank and Trust Company and the Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Company for $48,000 and $50,000 respectively. Persky leased out number 27 for 10 years, at the time, for a rate of  $2,400 a year. Property information specifies that the premises were to “be used for the sale of automobile, bicycle, radio and electrical supplies, as well as repairs and hardware.”
 
For a period between 1948 and 2012, 25 and 27 Broadway were home to a retail mainstay on the corridor, Cutler’s Records. Lee and Nat Cutler began the business in 1948 at 41 Broadway, moved a few doors down in 1953, and came to their final location in 1982. In 2012, the store was run by their grandson Phil Cutler, who assumed leadership of the location from his father, Jayson. He recounts that the store hosted visits from ”Tom Jones, Brenda Lee, Everly Brothers and Tony Bennett” which kept “life in the store very exciting.” 
 
One employee, Bob Briar, started selling records at Cutler’s in 1974 when he was just 17 years old and continued at the establishment until 2012. Briar has worked at the store since 1974, when he was 17 years old. Today, 21 Broadway is home to Junzi Kitchen, and 27 & 25 Broadway host an outlet of Barbour. 23 Broadway is home to women’s retail space, LouLou. Elm Campus properties rents apartments to Yale students in the space above the ground floor retail, charging  about $1200 a month for one bedroom units, and $1775 for two bedroom spaces.
','','[\'Residential\', \'Restaurant\', \'Commercial\']','[]','[\'Collegiate Gothic\', \'Tudor / English Vernacular Revival\']','[\'Yes, business hours\']','Since the late 17th century, the confluence of York, Broadway, and Elm Streets was home to one of the most thriving residential and commercial areas in New Haven. In the period between 1845 and 1865, Italianate commercial buildings began to appear in this commercial hub.  C.F. Tuttle, a grocer at 21 Broadway, and James Olmsted, a druggist at 1 Broadway, both moved in around this time. 21 Broadway predates its neighbor, 23-27 Broadway, a load bearing brick and masonry structure with concrete facade detailing dating back to 1929. 
 
As Yale expanded during the 19th century, the Broadway commercial area was influenced by the expansion and accompanying architectural changes on campus. Some buildings acquired facades specifically designed to harmonize with the new campus icons. The area also became increasingly dependent on the patronage of the university community, with several upscale tailors, Whitlock’s Bookstore and the Yale Co-op moving into the area in the 1920’s.
','3','With its sharply pointed roof and weathered brick and stone facade, 21 Broadway makes a distinctive aesthetic addition to the Broadway shopping district. Its two neighbors, Good Nature Market on the right and an Italianate style building with two clothing stores on left, emphasize the verticality of 21 Broadway, which almost seems to be squeezed up through the existing skyline set by the neighboring roofs. 

The presence of the new, fast-casual restaurant, Junzi Kitchen on the first floor of 21 Broadway heightens this architectural drama. The chic interior of Junzi, with its pale wood panelling and spare furnishings, makes for an interesting effect when paired with the neo-gothic facade of 21 Broadway. 
','[]','Under the umbrella of “The Shops at Yale,” 21 Broadway stylistically mimics other Neo-Gothic buildings of its landlord: Yale University. It is a member of a suite of properties that extends on the left hand side of the building and includes all the addresses up to 27. These properties are housed in the larger, brick, Italianate building that specialize in dry goods retail. Their European architectural influences make a successful aesthetic pairing with the upper-end retail outlets they house. We can find the Italianate character of The Shops At Yale with wood dentils that punctuate its roofline.

Upon his recent death on March 19, 2011, the building is now owned by his wife, Ryta Wozniak, however, the store has had new tenants since 2006–Grazyna (Grace) Ziolo continues the Polish deli business, as well as the Wozniak family tradition. Ziolo owns rights to Wozniak various recipes for perogi and horse radish sauce handmade in back of the store.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Despite the relative stability of the building’s commercial history as a family-run Polish deli, the Wozniak family business participated in the larger fabric of an evolving Polish community in New Haven, as well as a series of changing storefronts and New Haven’s changing urban landscape. Stanley Wozniak moved to 835 Grand Avenue from his previous location–603 East Street. His change of address is an example of the reshuffling of businesses as a result of I-91 development. His family’s business history reaches back, however, to his aunt, Rose Wozniak who arrived in the States in 1917 and settled in New Haven with her brother, Joseph. Shortly thereafter, she and her brother opened their first Polish deli on Congress Avenue which closed during the Depression because customers did not pay up. John, Joseph Wozniak’s son and also Stanley’s brother, ran a pharmacy on State and Humphrey not far from where the family lived on State and East Streets. Rose played an active role at Stanley’s store, doing most of the cooking for hot meals sold at the 835 store address.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">835 Grand Avenue is therefore a document of Polish ethnographic history in New Haven–its commercial health correlated to that of New Haven’s Polish community. The construction of I-91which led to the relocation of Stanley Wozniak’s East Street store to Grand Avenue, actually tore threw a large Polish residential community–the effects of which are felt strongly today. Most of the Polish community has moved to the suburbs. A parking lot across the street from Saint Stanislaus Church on State Street services those driving to New Haven for Polish Catholic mass. As a result, the Polish deli at 835 Grand Avenue caters to local and commuter Polish communities–it is a center of both native food products and news–an important gathering spot for the community, for example, to grieve the death of Poland’s president Lech Kaczynski in 2010. Despite its strong hold, the building itself points perhaps to a Polish community in transition or decline. The current store manager, Grace Ziolo continues to pay homage to the long history of Wozniak Meat Markets by keeping the Wozniak store sign, however her own history is marked by temporary banner although she has been in business 7 years. The deli has also expanded its product range to include other Eastern European traditions.</span></p><p><br></p>','N/A','[\'Commercial\']','[\'Masonry\']','[\'Modernist\']','[\'Yes, business hours\']','<p><span style="background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238); color: rgb(68, 68, 68);">Previously, 835-41 was home to Dale Furniture Company, whose corporate identity under the leadership of James W.

History of the Building:

Horace Thompson, a prominent and prosperous local mid-19th century builder and joiner, built 157 Olive Street for himself (most likely with his own hands). Thompson maintained his successful joiners shop at the rear of his property. The house reflects the early development of Olive Street as a primarily residential area. Horace was listed as living at this address by 1840 in the New Haven City Directory.  He was most likely employed in the construction of other nearby residences in the William, Lyon, and St. John Street areas.

Today 157 Olive Street is a currently operating as a two-family home.  It was most recently sold on April 3, 2009 for around $370,000.  It boasts 5 bedrooms, 20 bathrooms, and approximately 2,924 square feet of interior space.  The property has a lot size of 6,970 square feet and was built in 1880.

History of Residential Olive Street:

The New Township area, first developed in the early- to mid-18th Century expansion of the town, constituted the land to the east of the creek.  By the end of the century and the peak of maritime prosperity in New Haven, the neighborhood was the flourishing center of the seaport. Around this time it acquired its name, the ‘New Township,’ a title that reveals “both the maritime community’s confidence of future growth and also a sense of separateness from the rest of the town.” (Brown 179)

The plan to build the Farmington Canal in 1825 heightened demand for real estate in the area and brought about the construction of Wooster Square, a symbol of the community’s sense of status. By the 1830s it was becoming a more densely populated residential area:

“William Street from Olive to Franklin was opened by William Lefflingwell and Abraham Bradley in 1830 for the benefit of adjoining pastures…. A few years later Sidney M. Stone made a trade in the purchase of the pasture lot through the center of which opened Lyon Street from Olive to Bradley Street, securing a tier of building lots on the other side…. As the new crossroads were being opened and the new business enterprises began to develop on the Easter district of the city, quite a number of merchants and traders began to become interested and influenced to make investments and purchases of lots and parcels of the lands or the erection of tenement houses for sale, or rent…. ” (Morse)

While the failure of the canal in 1837 meant an end to the boom of development, it was not long until plans for the railroad—the state’s first—bolstered new hope for the community’s economic success. James Brewster, a carriage maker, built the railroad in 1839 along the eastern edge of the township. His carriage factory and the ‘industrial park’ he built around it marked the historical transition of the New Township from a maritime center to one of manufacturing. Up sprang the New Haven Clock Company, the Candee Rubber Boot Company and many more.  The industrial golden age of New Haven lasted from 1835 to 1865.

In architectural character the community remained self-contained.  The area exhibited satellite village clusters with side streets housing many skilled artisans and laborers and Chapel and Wooster Square boasting the more affluent homes of the heads of industries. Yet despite the lack of drastic outward change, over time the neighborhood suffered.  Post-revolution, most of the industry moved, primarily to Winchester. With the influx of foreign labor in the 1890s  (primarily Italian), the upper-middle class and factory owners fled the area. By the time of the depression the area was described as one of New Haven’s major slums and some of the older buildings, falling on disrepair, were torn down.

“Gasoline stations have been one of the chief reasons for the elimination of old time dwellings in these downtown neighborhoods, while another reason is the desire, in the present period of economic stress, to demolish non-income producing buildings so as to reduce the taxes upon the property… within the last few months the brownstone and brick dwellings at Chapel and Olive Streets have been torn down… today few of the ancient buildings, which spoke of the days when the wealthy resided there, remain standing.” (Atteres)

Yet, despite the economic downfall of the area—or perhaps, because of it—the architecture of the historic area, for the most part, remained unchanged. In the 1940s the New Township area narrowly avoided complete demolition by aggressive urban planning efforts, but by the 1960s the character of the neighborhood met new appreciation and the Redevelopment Agency’s Rehabilitation Program instated new zoning practices to preserve the area as a historic district:

 “Objectives: The major area of the Project is the residential portion anchored on the Wooster Square Green and extending from Olive Street to the new line of Interstate Route 91 and from a point below Wooster Street to the northernmost boundary.  The improvement and protection of this neighborhood will require the acquisition of a site for a new school and community center and the site of the Sacred Heart School for new residential construction.  The main neighborhood will be insulated from heavily travelled Water Street and its commercial-industrial frontage by the closing of Warren, Brewery and Brown Streets between Wooster and Water Streets and by the clearance of the predominantly industrial area north of this street facility.” (Redevelopment and Renewal Plan, 1961)

Records from the law firm of White Brothers, Clark, Hall and Peck in Sterling library’s Manuscripts and Archives give a conflicting date of 1849. The structure was residential, and remained so until the last records show that Gustave Stattig bequeathed this house in his will to various family members in 1950. The original footprint of the 1850 house is apparent from the roofline; a hip roof covers a square portion of the building corresponding to the Casablanca store and the second floor above it. Sanborn maps from 1901, 1911 and 1924 show that the house was enlarged in the back prior to 1901. I could not find further records in Sterling for post-1950, but in speaking with Steve Kovel, the owner of Hull’s University Art Supply and Framing, I learned that sometime in the 1950s Sid Bruskin set up a bicycle shop in the space, which remained for about thirty years under several owners, until it finally went bankrupt in the 1980s. The 1973 Sanborn map shows that the original structure width had been expanded to the size it is today, and various out-buildings had been attached. The assessor’s record lists the building’s “Effectual Year Built” as 1961, so the major expansion probably occurred at that time. Today, the Hull’s store occupies the entire first floor of this expanded half. This portion of the building was the bicycle shop until it went out of business, and then remained empty until 1999 when Steve Kovel bought the space and had Dean Sakamoto remodel it. A bicycle sign remains on the side of the building near the Casablanca store. The recent tenants of the other parts of the building, besides Casablanca, have all been architectural- and design-oriented. A small architectural firm had the back office on the second floor until the 1980s; when Dean Sakamoto renovated the building he connected this back office with the front office and set up his own firm in the expanded space in 2000. Prior to that time, Alec Purves rented the front office as a “retreat” from the A+A. Strong Cohen, a graphic design firm, has the third office space over the Hull’s store; Tom Strong of Strong Cohen was responsible for the graphics in the Hull’s renovation. Recently, Dean Sakamoto left the upstairs space, and Steve Kovel has been using the front portion as his office.','[]','','1850','[\'Chapel West\']','[]','','','1144 Chapel Street, New Haven, CT','41.3083769','','[\'Historic Chapel West and Dwight Edgewood\']','None','[]','[]');

University Towers was conceived under the Oak Street Redevelopment Project, New Haven’s first major urban renewal initiative. The vision for Oak Street included the construction of the highway connector, five 12-story apartment buildings (including University Towers), a large office building, large parking lot, and a number of Yale Medical School and Yale-New Haven hospital buildings. In 1955, a conceptual report was released entitled “The Redevelopment Project: Oak Street Area” in which the goals of redevelopment were listed as following: to build a better city wherein to work, play, &amp; live, to build a better business district for New Haven shoppers, and to establish a sound financial structure for a healthy community. The Oak Street redevelopment was to be the city’s first redevelopment project of its kind.

Most of the historical information about University Towers comes from a city commissioned report in 1962 that analyzes the project based on an apartment inventory, the rate of absorption, the characteristics of occupants, their place of employment, the previous place of residence of occupants, and their income and rent expenditures.

The report cited that of the 253 apartments, over 80% in 1962 had rent ranging between $120 and $260/month while the total range ran from $114 to $312/month at that time. The majority of the apartments are still one or two bedroom units, however about 10% are 6 ½ room apartments with three bedrooms. It took approximately 2 ½ years for the occupancy rate to reach 95% within the complex. Occupants were listed as primarily one and two-person households (comprising about 90% of the occupancy) and there were only seven families with children living there at the time. Most of the occupants worked in close proximity to University Towers.

Today, University Towers is still a residential development, with a doorman, trash, pool, and laundry facilities. In addition to residential units, the first and third floors also house medical offices. Current tax assessment forms list the breakdown of apartments as follows:92 one-bedroom units, 54 2-bedroom units , and 22 3-bedroom units (with all 2 and 3-bedroom apartments including 2 bathrooms.)

As of 2014 and continuing in 2015, the board of University Towers has undertaken several renovation initiatives on the building, including a balcony railing and window replacement project, and elevator upgrades.','[]','','1958','[\'Connector\']','[]','','','100 York Street New Haven, CT 06511','41.3069846','','[\'Historic Chapel West and Dwight Edgewood\']','None');

The beginnings of life here as a theater district first stirred in 1917, when the Rialto Theater opened on this block. However, the theater’s life came to a tragic end a short four years later, when it was destroyed by fire, with the loss of several lives. By the time the Rialto burned down, New Haven had established a viable theater district along College St. In keeping with this urban programming, the site of the former Rialto Theater, as well as several of the adjacent buildings, were redeveloped into the Roger Sherman Theater block in 1925, a simple brick-faced building holding the edge of the street with regular cinema hall and somewhat amorphous Palace Theater behind. At the time, there was an opera house occupying the center of the block (behind the Union League Café), and the building’s form had to respond to the footprint of the opera, thus producing its irregular shape. The north and east (facing College St.) ends of the building are 186 feet by 152 feet, five stories, with poured concrete foundation and loadbearing masonry walls. It originally had a broad, segmental arch parapet above the steel and glass marquee entrance, though this no longer exists. The Palace Theater was in use until the just after the turn of the 21st century, and closed in 2002.

Nesbit','[\'Commercial\']','[]','[]','[]','','','In 1909, under the auspices of G.G. Nesbit, Brown and von Beren Architects was commissioned to build a freestanding masonry structure with structural steel girders and concrete floors to function as a garage adjacent to New Haven’s burgeoning Chapel District. Over the next hundred years, and up to the present, 39/41 High Street has stood the test of time and programmatic changes, representing what is one of High Street’s oldest standing structures. Fire insurance Sanborn maps from 1930 indicate that the building was a four story, 70-car garage, with concrete floors, that was heated via steam. These records also indicate that, perhaps due to its nature as housing a car rental/taxi business, a 1000 gallon gasoline tank was buried beneath what is presently the entrance to the 39 High Street portion.

Though it is one building, the placards on the door lintels indicate two separate addresses 39 and 41 High Street. This ornamentation has to do that for much of its life the building had separate commercial programs operating within its structure, though often in a symbiotic relationship.  When it was erected, the new garage housed The Blue Ribbon Garage and the New Have taxi Cab Companies. Originally a freestanding structure, the structure was joined with its ancillary wing sometime around 1913. This is indicated because the 1911 Atlas of New Haven shows the structure standing alone but the 1913 phone directory lists a 45 High Street that houses the Maynyard W.A. &amp; Co Automobiles shop. Through its lifespan the building underwent several name and ownership changes but remained programmatically constant, always servicing the automobile industry in some form.  By the early 1920s New Haven Taxi Cab Co. had left to be replaced by H&amp;P Motor Livery and Combined Auto Crafts Co., the latter of which is listed as occupying 41-45 High Street. In the mid to late 1920s some of the auto shops were taken over by New Haven Car Renting Co. Henceforth from the 1930s until 1987 the building was known as the High Street Garage (with a brief exception in the early 1960s when it was known as the Palace Garage). No pictures exist of the garage in its past configurations.

The garage changed owners a couple of times. City records indicated that in 1951 Frank Nuzzo was the owner and for some time in the mid-50s a rental car company called "U-Drive it of New Haven" also occupied the building. When the garage changed ownership in the early 1960s, the rental car company either went out of business or moved somewhere else. The building was bought in 1986 by Barbara Wareck in conjunction with its two story 45 High Street Neighbor. Her son John Wareck now owns the property under the company Wareck D’Ostilio. Throughout late 1987 the building was cleared from its previous uses and remodeled for a total cost of $1.2 million (1987 dollars). In the late 1980s its current tenants moved in: Pelli Clarke Pelli and Chapel Investment. Its last major upgrade was in 1995 when 39 High Street was cleared via permit for a restaurant remodel totaling $110,000 (1996 dollars). This is the space that would go on to house Ibiza and currently Olea which opened in 2015.

As of September 2015 the building was granted a permit to redo its roofing for a total cost of $366,000, for which construction has yet to begin as of October 2015.','[]','','','[]','[]','Brown and van Beren','','41 High Street, New Haven, CT, 06511','41.3075525','','[\'Touring Chapel, Crown & High\']','None','[]','[]');

It anchors the street corner with its presence, in a scale similar to Berzelius society across the street, as well as other residential buildings that surround it on its North and West faces. Its use has changed over the more than 100 years since it was built, but its structure has remained relatively unchanged.

Site

The site of the structure originally belonged to land owned by Russel H. Chittenden, who was the owner of a large tract of land along Whitney and Trumbull avenues. According to the legal record of the site, a significant portion of the land was then transferred to the DeForest family and Thomas H. Russell before the 1880s. No legal documentation of this transfer was kept, however, it is referred to in later discussion of the land, and the land appears divided in the 1888 lithograph of the town. Over the period 1886-1889, Charles S. Thomas Russell acquired the land belonging to the DeForest Family, as well as an additional small tract from Chittenden, to form the land that the structure sits on today. Because of the cobbling together of land from various sources, the site bears two addresses, which it has kept since 1889: 79 Trumbull Street and 100 Whitney Avenue. It is likely that the house was built by Russell in the period 1889-1892, at which point he transferred ownership to his wife, who owned the structure into the 20th century.

Architecture

The structure itself is three story main house above a half-level basement. It was constructed in the Richardsonian Romanesque style, and is one of the few surviving Richardsonian Romanesque structures in New Haven. The style, popularized at the end of the 19th century by Henry Hobson Richardson, the architect who designed the Trinity Church in Boston, is characterized by a picturesque and solid-appearing construction. It is brick with brownstone highlights around arches, windows, and between levels. Typical of its style is the prominent peaked and gabled roof, with round and polygonal turrets piercing it at irregular intervals. It has a prominent chimney on its Whitney Ave. face, which adds to the appearance of height as well as visually offsetting a large round turret on its southwest corner.

Moving down from the roof, the windows of the house are straight-topped, with heavy brownstone window dressing and lintels, which add to the weighty sense of the structure. The windows themselves are irregularly and asymmetrically placed in many instances, characteristic of the picturesque quality of the style, and obscuring the interior layout of the house, as windows are of varying heights and are scattered over the outside wall at irregular intervals.

The south face of the house on to Trumbull street houses its main entrance, with a large, rounded, recessed arch framing the it, and a two-flight staircase approaching the front door, which does not face the street, but is rather set into the left side of the arch. A second, smaller entrance exists on Whitney Ave. near the north end of the house. There is also a separate basement entrance on Whitney, directly below the back door entrance. The base of the structure is faced in stone, and there are small ground-level windows that give light to the basement.

The overall appearance of the house is an irregular mix of curved and angular forms, which combine to create a structure that speaks of permanence and massiveness. As a three-storey single family home, the structure would have been a very impressive status symbol, and would have stood out from the surrounding houses both because of its darker brick-and-stone construction and for it asymmetricality.

Use

The structure was build c. 1890 as a single-family home. In an interesting legal arrangement, it was sold by Thomas H. Russell, through a middle man, to Mary K. Russell for $1. After this transfer of ownership, the building did not change hands until 1928, when Yale University bought it from Mary K. Russell. The University sold the property to Louis M. Cantor of New Hampshire in 1945, who in turn sold it in 1958 to Adam J. Sasorski. Sasorski converted the home into mixed-use apartment housing and office space, an arrangement that has persisted to this day.

Sasorski, in 1965, sold the property to its last recorded owners, Rhoda Pesty and Donald Cole, investors from outside the New Haven area who have subsequently renovated the structure to bring it up to code for use as a commercial/residential property, including fire escapes and insulation. Today its first two floors and basement serve as office space for eight psychologists, occupational therapists, and mental health counselors. Its third floor is divided into three apartments. The interior space does not retain a home-like feel, but rather evokes a dark, closed warren of offices with little common space.

Though today the structure does not retain its former glory as the extravagant home of a wealthy New Haven resident, it remains an important and imposing presence in its neighborhood. Its mixed-used character proves that as a structure, it can adapt to new city circumstances, while at the same time its exterior visual character has remained relatively unchanged since the late 19th century.','[]','','1889-1892','[]','[]','','','79 Trumbull Street, New Haven, CT','41.3134224','','[\'The Whitney Avenue Walk\']','None');

A Yale Professor, Mr. Crawford (whose first name I could not establish) was one of the earliest and strongest proponents of Theater Studies as an academic discipline, and was integral to the formation of the Yale Theater Studies Department. He and his wife were two of the founders of The Little Theater, and as we will see, it was their daughter who, decades later, would rescue it from destruction. The earliest record of ownership for the property at 1 Lincoln Street attributes it to a Roger S White who acquired it in the late 19\'" century. After several decades of ownership, on September 17, 1915, he sold it to Thomas B Osborne who would own the property for eight years, until 1923. 1 Lincoln Street had a short career as personal, residential property: in 1923 it became The Little Theater. In the early 1920s, the Crawfords and several of their friends started the Theater Guild Co., to advocate participation in theater among amateurs and children. This organization was inspired by a larger movement at the time, called Little Theater, which advocated more subtle, small-scale theater (as opposed to the large production melodramas that were dominant at the time), and also developed theater programs for non-professionals and children.

In 1923, the Theater Guild Co. entered into negotiations with Thomas B Osborne. The Crawford\'s lived on Lincoln Street, and wanted the theater to be built in their neighborhood. The Theater Guild Co. raised the funds for the land and the building from the New Haven community. At a meeting of the Theater Guild at the office of their Secretary, Eliot Watrons, the Guild voted to purchase not only Mr Osborne\'s land for a total of $6,000, but also pieces of the surrounding properties, including those of Charles S Miller, John A Myer, Edward F and Mary F Camey, and The Congregation Mishkan Israel. Once the Little Theater was constructed, children would rehearse and put on plays on the weekends. The Crawfords own children participated, and the theater thrived for several years as a community institution. But it could not sustain itself for long. and within fifteen years it was converted into a movie theater. In the 1930s, it became popular for movie producers to own their own cinemas, in order to guarantee spaces for their films to be shown. The Little Theater was first purchased by Joseph Levane, and subsequently by Major Bowles of Major Bowles Amateur Hour. Finally, it was purchased by the Spotek Brothers, who later owned York Square Cinema. Under their ownership, the Little Theater was used to show foreign and art house films, and occasionally a more risque movie, which it is still remembered for among some members of the community. In 1978 there was a strike among the Little Theater\'s projectionists for, what the newspaper describes as, "breach of contract, sex discrimination, and unsafe working conditions."

Although the dispute was settled, the late seventies and early eighties saw the trend toward large multiplex cinemas, and finally the Spotek Brothers found that their cinema was no longer sustaining itself. The paper reported, about the last day of the Lincoln Theater cinema: Winding up a 50-year run, the Lincoln Theater will go dark tonight after an all-day screening of The Last Picture Show. The Little Theater remained empty for years. In the 1980s, the Arts Council of the Greater New Haven area began plans to redevelop the Audobon Street area. The Little Theater, at the very end of Lincoln Street, backs onto the buildings of Audobon. The development plans for Audobon, which included several new community arts buildings, as well as office, parking, and housing developments, included a plan to destroy the old, empty Theater and extend its housing development over that property. The younger Ms. Crawford, (now not so young) who had grown up performing in the little Theater, saw the destruction of the little Theater as a significant loss to the neighborhood. Together with some of her fellow child-actors and other members of the community, she led the effort to "SAVE THE LINCOLN." They argued that ~ was Historically ~ not Architecturally Significant, and that its location and scale contributed to the neighborhood character. They submitted to the Trust for Historic Preservation, describing that it was vacant and in danger of demolition by the City of New Haven, which owned it. They got it registered with the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Finally they had saved it but didn\'t know what to do with it. At that time the ECA (Educational Center for the Arts) had a drama program that was rapidly expanding, and they were beginning to outgrow the Temple building. The Director of ECA worked with the Arts Council to transfer the Little Theater to ECA. This brought its use full circle once again used to help kids explore theater. It was approved by the State Department School Facilities committee and the City sold the building to ECA for $1 or some nominal amount. It was swept up in the POD (Planned District Development) program of the New Haven Arts Center, and at that point it was remodeled. In 1985 it was approved by the State Department of Education. The Spotek Bros had taken the name The Lincoln Theater, so when it reopened its name was reverted to the original: The Little Theater on Lincoln Street. There are classroom facilities, as well as a theater that seats 500. It has 7,650 sq feet of retail and services space, and 14,000 of space used for administration and classrooms.

ARCHITECTURE

In 1924, the previously-existing building was tom down, and the Little Theater was constructed. The large concrete building was designed by the local architecture firm Gray and Lawrence. It stands today. despite renovations, much as it was originally constructed: it is one and one half stories in front and two stories in the rear, as many theaters provide additional height above the stage for the operation of sets; the roof was gabled in the front and flat in the rear; and the front area was sided with stucco. The only architectural element of note was the horseshoe arch at the front, which has been preserved through renovations. Although the original awning no longer exists, and the front is now entirely concrete, it has maintained the integrity of the original, simple design. With the incorporation in to ACES and the acquisition of the building by the ECA, the Little Theater had to undergo some basic renovations, primarily for issues of safety. It was remodeled by Donald Baerman, AlA from North Haven, who is still practicing there. After multiple experiences of wood door failure, Mr Baerman finished the front doors himself. The east leader heads were also added at this point. The construction manager was David Dickson, who still works in New Haven but who I didn\'t get a chance to talk to.

COMMUNITY

What was notable was that the Arts Council was so willing to work with community members to execute their idea of what their community should consist of. Ultimately it was also beneficial to the redevelopment of the area, as the presence of the theater is an attraction for the people who live in those new communities.','[]','','1924','[\'Whitney-Audubon\']','[]','Gray and Lawrence','','1 Lincoln Street, New Haven, CT','41.311751','','[\'The Whitney Avenue Walk\']','None');

To trace the history of Audubon is to watch New Haven transition from an agrarian town, to an industrial center, to a post-industrial wilderness and, finally, to a reemerging hub of culture and commerce. The modern history of Audubon St. began in 1850 with the construction of the New Haven Manufacturing Co. on the northeast corner of Whitney and Audubon. This factory constructed sewing machines, and dominated much of the area with both its sheer size and economic power. To the east of the factory were several sheds and carriage houses, and two medium-sized wooden houses at 73 and 69 Audubon. (The numbering along the street changed often and sometimes awkwardly, so I will use the addresses that most closely correspond to the present situation for easy reference.) The New Haven Manufacturing Co., along with the McLagon Foundry and Andrew B. Hendryx Co. across the street, made Audubon the major industrial center of New Haven. Despite this trend, the homes at 73 and 69 Audubon remained intact for over 100 years, though they frequently changed owners. In 1897 they were joined by the Temple Mishkan Israel on the corner of Audubon and Orange, a looming structure that is either Romanesque Revival, Spanish Renaissance or Edwardian in architectural style, depending on whom you ask.

The first major changes struck Audubon in 1916, when the New Haven Manufacturing Co. left its factory. The plant was leased to the Driggs Ordinance Co., which converted the factory first to weapons production for the remainder of World War I, and then to automobile engine production. Later the factory was used for other purposes, including printing and textiles, at times being subdivided among multiple tenants. In 1944 it was demolished. The homes, sheds, and temple to its east were largely unchanged during this period. However, things began to change quickly in the 1950s and 1960s. A smaller building with large parking fields in front of and behind it was built in place of the New Haven Manufacturing plant; for a time it served as a car dealership, but soon fell vacant, as did the other manufacturing buildings and eventually the homes. The City of New Haven began buying up vacant property and buildings and paving them over to create parking lots as a part of the greater urban renewal plan for the City. As Mishkan Israel’s congregation moved to the suburbs, so did the synagogue, removing the last bit of activity from Audubon Street. For more than two decades, what had once been the industrial center of the City was a lifeless ghost of its former self.

In the late 1960s, plans began to form over what to do with Audubon Street. Because of the recession in the 1970s, these plans were largely stalled, though in 1972 the ACES Educational Center for the Arts moved into the vacated Mishkan Israel building, preceding the rebirth of Audubon as a center of art and culture. The City began calling for Audubon to become a mixed-use, “traditional” district, combining some of the preexisting buildings with new construction. The Greater New Haven Arts Council (GNHAC) was given control over the area, with a mandate to create arts centers, schools, housing, retail and office space. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the first phase of this project kicked into gear, as the southern half of the street was rebuilt and refurbished. Once this was complete, the GNHAC looked north. With promises of tax breaks and money for landscaping from the City, plans were made to create a new, mixed-use complex that would bring new life to the area while respecting New Haven’s history.

Construction began on Audubon Court in 1986. The development covered the entirety of the northern side of the street from Whitney Avenue to the Educational Center for the Arts. Acting in close cooperation with the GNHAC, the City of New Haven and Yale, lead developer Lawrence Investing Company hired New Haven architectural firms Roth &amp; Moore (for the office component) and Herbert S. Newman Associates (now Herbert S. Newman and Partners, for the residential component). These firms have each had a strong hand in the reshaping of New Haven over the last 25 years; their interest in brick buildings that recall the City’s colonial past has resulted in the Joseph Slifka Center, Arthur K. Watson Hall, and the Ninth Square District. For Audubon Court, they created 80,000 square feet of office space, 61 condominiums, 20,000 square feet of first floor retail and nearly 400 parking spaces. The project was intended to complete the redevelopment of Audubon Street, creating a South Street Seaport-like atmosphere conducive to pedestrians. However, the huge number of parking spaces in garages on the street made it impossible to completely close off to cars, and shows that it was unlikely that either the city or the developer ever seriously considered fully pedestrianizing Audubon. As a sort of compromise, Leeney Plaza was built in front of the eastern part of the development, giving shoppers and visitors a place to sit and relax while cars were forced to slow down considerably as they traveled towards Orange Street. The entire project cost $30 million. The Lincoln Theater was also renovated during this time, completing the new Arts District.

The project was completed in 1988. Along with the changes to the southern half of the street, including the earlier projects such as the Arts Council Building and the restoration of the foundry buildings near Whitney, Audubon had been completely transformed in about 10 years after seeing only slow changes for the previous 100. However, problems remained. Facing a sluggish market for both office and residential real estate, Audubon Court fell on hard times soon after being completed. In 1992, the Knights of Columbus rescued the development from receivership for $6.3 million dollars. At the time, there were 28 unsold condos, and the major office presence, Connecticut Bank and Trust, was sold and promptly moved out. However, as the market turned around in the last 15 years, so did the vitality of Audubon Court. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the remaining condos and retail spaces were purchased and occupied. The Knights were bought out, as Yale grabbed the office space and residents swarmed to the condominiums, many seeking a respite from the high prices of Manhattan. Tax records indicate a relatively low rate of turnover in the residences, while value has generally skyrocketed: in 2006, one of the larger condo units sold for $424,999, up from $135,000 in 1993 (which was far below the initial $250,000 asking price, highlighting the difficulties of the early 1990s market). Another early problem was a preponderance of professional offices in the new retail space. While this matched the character of the larger area, it did not create the vibrant, 24/7 atmosphere the developers and City had hoped for. Over time, however, true retail moved in, along with outdoor tables and benches and the popular September Saturdays festival, bringing the once morose street to life.

Because of the rapid consolidation and division of properties during urban renewal in the ‘70s and the multi-phased redevelopment in the ‘80s, the older system of addresses began to lose meaning. For example, the entire Audubon Court project has the address 95 Audubon, though the condominium section is often identified as 71-75. The City of New Haven still owns many of the smaller, in-between parcels that feature out of use numbers, but they are generally tiny or exist only in the legal sense. The most important of these is 73 Audubon, which is a well maintained pathway between the two residential buildings, linking Lincoln Street to Audubon and Leeney Plaza. Surrounded by handsome buildings and simple but effective landscaping, this path connects the many professional offices and residences on and above Trumbull Street to the arts and retail district on Audubon. Many pedestrians prefer this path to taking Whitney as a way to avoid the noise and automobile traffic of the major thoroughfare; many students from the schools on and near Audubon use this a way to get home, or to the buses which wait for them one block north on Lincoln Street. The pleasant scenery and relative quiet, as well as the small shops, Koffee, and Leeney Plaza make Audubon a very desirable place to escape the office and relax during a lunch break. Audubon Street has become one of the most interesting and unique parts of New Haven, where history and progress are tied together by culture and activity.','[]','','1986','[\'Whitney-Audubon\']','[]','Roth & Moore, Herbert S Newman Associates','','71-75 Audubon Street, New Haven, CT','41.3115376','','[\'The Whitney Avenue Walk\']','None');

The property originally included ten acres of land reaching from where the house stood on the comer of Whitney and Grove to Prospect and Orange Streets. It was passed down to the younger James Hillhouse, well known for serving the state of Connecticut in Congress and later working for Yale University as treasurer. The Hillhouse property was sold and became Grove Hall, a boarding school for girls, in 1840. In the hands of the school directors, Mrs. Hutton and later Professor Hubbard , the building was doubled in size by traditional hand-build additions. The New Haven register lovingly refers to these historic methods, "the additions to the original house can be traced easily; and the hand wrought nails; the hewn stone foundations, curving stone steps ... belong to the real colonial type"\'

In 1925 Grove Hall was demolished as New Haven began to transition from a town of mansions and lawns to a city designed for the automobile and the influx of consumers that came with it. Some saw this change as the demolition of history. In the "Now and Then" series, the New Haven Register reminded its readers of the monumentality of historic buildings like Grove Hall. Describing its history as the home of a political figure and then an academic institution, the Register mournfully explains, " it must follow that almost every person of note in political, intellectual and social life who was in New Haven, from Nathan Hale, Aaron Burr, and Noah Webster to Huxley and Dana, must have entered that door"\'. In 1931 the Whitney-Grove building was built in the Tudor Revival style by the Whitney-Grove Association\'. It was, and continues to be, a mixed use building, with commercial space on the ground floor and office space above. The first tenant of the Whitney-Grove building was Mesrick C.S. and Co, a plumbing and hardware emporium. A billboard on the roof of the building, much like the one there today, advertised their name and the slogan "Modernize your bathroom"·. The building and its billboard were like the sign post for urbanization at the foot of the newly commercial Whitney Avenue.','[]','','1931','[\'Whitney-Audubon\']','[\'Brick\']','','','1 Whitney Avenue','41.3106011','','[\'The Whitney Avenue Walk\']','[]','[]','None');

In the late 1980’s, Konover Associates of West Hartford oversaw the implosion of the Century Building, an eight-story mixed-use low-rise that housed offices, apartments, and first-floor retail and had been developed by then-owner and New Haven resident Michael Koury in 1926. Designed by Cesar Pelli Architects &amp; Associates, an architectural firm based on Chapel Street in New Haven, One Century Tower was built in 1989.

Now one of the tallest buildings in New Haven, the tower stands as a bookend at one terminus of the Church Street financial and institutional district. The modern role of this office tower is interesting in light of the history of the site on which the building stands. The corner of Church and Grove Streets lies along the northeastern edge of New Haven’s original nine squares. In fact, from New Haven’s beginnings Captain Nathaniel Turner, the military commander of the New Haven Colony, owned the land along Church Street between Grove and Wall – a strategic position in the defense of the colony against Indians tribes to the east. Today, the tower’s enormous parking garage invites workers into New Haven from well outside the original nine squares, while the security desk in the lobby turns away those not doing business in the offices above.

The stone facades outside the first-floor People’s Bank and Fidelity Investments offices match the streetscape of Church Street’s institutional buildings, especially the courthouse next door. Meanwhile, the brick that adorns the outside of the upper eighteen floors distinguishes the building from many surrounding buildings, while still blending in with architectural elements prevalent in New Haven.','[]','','1989','[\'Downtown\']','[]','Cesar Pelli & Associates','','265 Church Street, New Haven, CT','41.3100378','','[\'The Whitney Avenue Walk\']','None');

It houses six families, but the stylish asymmetry, wood siding, and decorative detail makes the building look like an ailing mansion. In a neighborhood of derelict factories on a block with five other homes turned apartments, a converted mansion seems nothing out of the ordinary.[1] But, in fact, unlike the other five apartments, 201 Winchester has always been an apartment building.[2] A trivial fact, maybe, but this historical fact likely influenced its other idiosyncrasies. The building stretches all the way out to the sidewalk while most other buildings in the neighborhood are set back from the street. Its architecture is different too – the way it lines up with the other houses, the bay windows, the columns, and the elegant corbelled cornices. Unfortunately no historical documents remain to give an explicit rationale for the building’s design: the ebb of history has washed away the plans and permits of the building’s construction. Still, titles and deeds provide us with the means for a partial reconstruction.

The story begins relatively late for 201 Winchester. Sandborn Maps indicate that in 1901 the block was largely undeveloped. By 1911 every plot but two had a building. One was Sarah Winchester’s L-shaped plot on the corner of Winchester and Tilton – the future site of 201 Winchester.[3] The other was an adjacent plot on Tilton St., once also owned by Winchester, but sold in 1900 to Charles Schnell.[4] In 1911 the carpenter Louis Caplan bought Winchester’s land. But historical documentation leaves unclear whether he built on that land.

What is clear is that by 1915, when the New Haven directory started listing citizens by address, there was an apartment at 201 Winchester. Furthermore, in 1912 Caplan parceled the land, sold a truncated corner lot to the real estate company Lomas and Nettleton, and simultaneously bought the Schnelle plot.

But did he build on the corner plot before selling? I will try to provide some evidence to answer that question. We know that in 1912, after acquiring the Schnelle plot, he took out a mortgage for $6250 (~$140,000 in 2008 dollars) and probably used this to build Tilton 38-44 as seen on the 1924 Sandborn Map.[5] He must have built something because in 1913 he sold his property to four occupants. When in 1917 Louis Caplan gave his company to his three sons, they took out another loan for $8200 (again ~140,000 in 2008 dollars) which may have been used to build both 34-6 and 46-8 Tilton. There is no record, however, of a mortgage for 201 Winchester leaving it unclear who built it and when.[6]

The Caplans’ activities are well documented and they used a mortgage to build the other two houses; this evidence suggests that Lomos and Nettleton built the 201 Winchester apartment. Never-the-less, I believe that the Caplans actually built 201, and built it before the three Tilton houses. My rationale is that the apartment building bears a number of striking resemblances to the three Tilton houses, which it seems very likely were built by the Caplans. Moreover, I do not believe that a mutual architect can explain the coincidence. First, I will address the similarities of the four buildings, and second, the question of an architect.

Most of the houses along Winchester Avenue are built parallel to Woodland and Tilton Streets meaning that they face Winchester at an angle. And most houses are set back from the street providing a peculiar triangular yard. Although 201 Winchester is also built parallel to Tilton, it does not have a triangular yard because the house extends all the way to the street. Instead a front yard is replaced by a small balcony/porch on each of the three floors. To forego a yard makes sense for an apartment building because shared spaces are less likely to be carefully tended. A balcony also provides private outdoor space for each of the residents. Surprisingly, the three houses down Tilton are also built all the way out to the street, and again with a porch instead of a front yard. While replacing the yard with a balcony seems clever for an apartment, for a double or single-family home this contrivance seems detrimental. It seems that the three other buildings used 201 Winchester as a model for their design. Furthermore, the double bay windows on the Titlton side of 201 Winchester are fairly unique to the street as most other houses on Winchester have flat fronts. A few houses on Mansfield do have single bay windows, still none have doubles. However, the three Tilton houses, like the apartment, also have double bay window. The stylistic similarities despite functional differences are hard to account for without an explanation of influence.[7]

A mutual architect would certainly the similarities of design. But I think it unlikely that the Caplans used an architect. “L Caplan and Sons” is listed in the 1915 telephone directory as a carpentry company.[8] However, title records indicate that instead of renting, the Caplans actually sold the Tilton Street houses, provided the buyers with mortgages directly, and then bought the houses back when people wanted to leave.[9] Thus the Caplans were not only carpenters, but real estate agents, and bankers. Given their jack-of-all-trades mentality, it seems likely that they built the Tilton houses themselves – perhaps as a way to generate carpentry business – and doubtful that they used an architect. Their carpentry skills might also account for the careful detailing. Therefore, while other explanations are certainly plausible, I believe that the Caplans probably built all four buildings. It is the ingenuity and utility of the apartment building that led to the unusual design of the other three houses.

[7] A related observation is that the Caplans sold Lomas and Nettleton a very small plot which provided almost no space for a yard. If L and N already had architectural plans for the space, then they might have known how much space they needed. Otherwise, the property would stick out as the only plot without yard space on the block and could hardly seem desirable.

The red-brick façade is set back quite a distance from the street, giving it an extensive and well-manicured green lawn. While the landscaping is limited to shrubs of varying sizes, 511 Prospect Street gives the impression of being an inviting building and a residence for a middle-class family.

The building is constructed of a combination of load bearing masonry and a wood frame with an asphalt-shingled hip-roof . The concrete walkway leads in a straight path up to the slightly porched (or gabled roof ) entryway that sits under a white, wooden pediment and thin, painted, square posts. The front of the Whitehall Apartments is hardly imposing, and neither is its entrance. In fact, the symmetrically placed pediment entryway seems disproportionately small in relation to the flat, wide front of the rest of the building.

511 Prospect Street was constructed in 1956. The land was purchased between 1901 and 1911 by Yale University. It remained a vacant lot until the Second World War when New Haven residents used the land for Victory Gardens , which were meant to reduce pressure on the public food supply by growing vegetables, fruits and herbs in a residential setting. Yale then sold the empty lot to the Prudential Insurance Company in 1945. The land was appraised for $154,500 at the time it was sold. Prudential built the Whitehall Apartments in 1956, which cover 16 acres of Prospect Street. It was meant to house 100 families in 400 rooms.

The building was also meant to be architecturally harmonious with the Yale Divinity School, which is just down Prospect. The unknown architect certainly made considerable efforts in doing so, but the Divinity School has a style more similar to Thomas Jefferson’s Monticello with its high, brick arches, and shuttered windows . However, it is no wonder that Prudential Insurance Company produced only a passable resemblance of the Divinity School since it was, after all, housing for middle-class families. While no view of the inside of the building was obtained, its exterior suggests that the Whitehall Apartments were built to maximize living space first, and confront matters of luxury next.

On April 2, 1959, a permit was obtained to erect a frame brick veneer for $425,000 . On July 10, 1959, the ownership had switched to Whitney Incorporated who obtained a permit to “erect multi-dwelling” for $220,000 . These are the only pieces of evidence that additions or remodels were ever performed on 511 Prospect Street.

In 1964-5, Yale University bought the apartments back in order to house married graduate students, and for university rentals in general. Yale now owns a great portion of the land in this area of Prospect Street, which will make expansion infinitely easier.

The simple brick boxes that form 511 Prospect Street depict a combination of the Colonial Revival and vernacular modern styles . The plain, white, wooden windows are constant throughout the design, but the building’s façade remains incredibly flat. In fact, one could argue that the history of the building, what with the changing ownership and demographic of its residents, is more interesting than the physical appearance of the building itself. The Whitehall Apartments are surrounded by brick buildings on all sides—some that are architecturally more appealing than Whitehall. However, 511 Prospect Street has been serving its purpose since it was built. It has housed families, students, and students with families.','[]','','1956','[\'Prospect Hill\']','[]','','','511 Prospect Street, New Haven, CT','41.3268271','','[\'Industry & Luxury around Prospect Hill\']','None');

The houses are two-story brick-veneer with attached garage, each set back from the street approximately 55 feet. All of the cottages now have very diverse appearances in color and decoration, though it is unclear whether, when built, they all sported the same style. At the very least, they all initially featured identical layout and size.

Building permit records for this property go back to 1926 in the New Haven Buildings Department, when the entire area covering these cottages and the area behind them was owned by a single man, Harry Cohen (Fig. 2). The first buildings to be built at these addresses were not the cottages, but instead five three-family wood-frame tenements, finished in October 1926 for $9,000 each. Maps produced by the Sanborn Company show the evolution of the Prospect Avenue site over the twentieth century. In 1911, the majority of the block is owned by two men and is entirely empty (two small buildings exist at Harriet, now Huntington, and Winchester Streets, at the northwest corner of the lot). Thirteen years later, in 1924, the western edge of the lot, along Winchester Street, has been developed into a row of near-identical structures running along the street. The dimensions given for Harry Cohen’s tenements (24’x48’) almost exactly match the size and proportion of these other structures, implying that they, too, are likely tenements. The portion along Prospect Street is empty, although two larger single-family homes have been built directly north of where the cottages will be built.

The site sees significant change between 1924 and 1973, when the next Sanborn map is produced. Small houses or tenements fill the western half of the block; access to them is aided by the addition of a private street. The cottages have now been constructed on a deep piece of land; the map notes that they are built of cinder blocks with brick facing. The two larger homes present on the 1924 map are still present.

Larger versions of the attached Sanborn maps may be accessed at &lt;http://www.library.yale.edu/MapColl/print_sanborn.html&gt;.

The cottages began being built by the contractors Harlaco, Inc. in 1950 for $8,000 each as single-family residences. There are no papers pertaining to the tenements’ demolition, but the owner of all five properties is now Charlotte Labov. The buildings were complete in 1951, after which the first tenants began to take residence. The collections of the New Haven Museum &amp; Historical Society contain no information about the cottages, suggesting both that they have been seen as an unexceptional part of the urban fabric and that they have had no famous tenants. Reverse directories for the City of New Haven confirm construction details discovered elsewhere: The cottages were constructed between 1950 and 1951. The directories have no entry for the cottages in 1950, and show all five cottages as existing but unoccupied in 1951. A ten-year survey of their tenants, from 1951-61, suggests that tenancy has been stable, with little-to-no turnover.

Despite the changes in tenants that did occur throughout the decade, Charlotte Labov remained owner of most of the houses for nearly that entire time, signifying that the families in residence were renters. These cottages were thus in a unique position: offering better housing than the nearby tenements with their privacy and the independence of one’s own garage, yet also being intended not for owners, but for temporary residents. If there had been records on the residents for that decade, one could have a better idea of who would live on such a property, but perhaps the fact that there are no records on anyone who lived in them in these years is sign enough of the type of family who would live in miniature faux-upscale houses for rent.

By the end of the ’50s and into the ’60s, each cottage was one-by-one sold off to separate owners. At this point, the cottages began to receive individual improvements and modifications, such as adding masonry additions to the back of a garage of 634 in 1955, enclosing the entry porch of 648 in 1958, adding a 10’x14’ addition to the back of 648 in 1988, all the way to upping the circuitry of 630 to 100 amps in 2001. The individual ownership over the years has lent each house a bit more individuality and variation in appearance, though for the most part they seem to remain near-identical in plan.','[]','','1951','[\'Prospect Hill\']','[]','','','630-648 Prospect Street, New Haven, CT','41.3295009','','[\'Industry & Luxury around Prospect Hill\']','None');

In fact, 142 York Street has not changed much at all since its creation, but rather has been able to adapt to the changing landscape of its neighbors. Both 142 and 146 are very similar Row houses built in the mid-nineteenth century. The exact construction date is unknown, however there is photographic evidence of their existence as of 1868. The building has a brick façade with brownstone steps, and rests three and one half stories tall. The window sills are modestly molded out of stone, and the entrance sits on a stoop of medium height with fairly bare ornamentation on the small door hood. The building may be typed as a Greek Revival Row house because of such features.

The inhabitants of 142 York have shifted throughout the years. The earliest recorded being a Mr. William Crowley in 1913, who worked as a rail road inspector. The building seems to have a history that always houses more than one occupant. My guess is that it started as a two-unit house. Although the inhabitants of 142 York Street seem to frequently change, its sister of 146 York remains owned by Yale throughout most of its history. The first consistent owner that 142 York Street sees is the family of John and Elizabeth McMahon in 1924, eventually widowed in 1935, Mrs. McMahon stays in the house until around 1945. Around this time the surrounding buildings included a Bakery across the street, S.S. Thompson &amp; Co. Bakery. The Bakery begins in 1886, and consistently expands through the 20th century until it is eventually occupied by the Yale Press. Also in the early 1900s, the Yale Medical School was right next to 146 York Street. This obviously also gave 142 more of a campus and almost progressive feel to it. As a matter of fact, in 1901 Yale Medical School was the only building on the block that had “heat, steam, light, and gas”.

In around 1960 the use of the building changes for the first time. As well as having residents, a “Lou’s Delicatessen” moves in. Lou’s is the first time this building incorporates a commercial component. Around this same time, the Yale Medical School is replaced with the York Street parking garage. All of these changes happen alongside the construction of the Oak Street Connector, modern day Route 34.

By 1974, Shanghai Village replaces Lou’s Delicatessen. Currently, 142 York has a cement protrusion that allows for a separate commercial entrance. This construction could have possibly happened when Shanghai Village took ownership. This frontal protrusion is the only evidence of exterior construction there has been since its original construction. Today, 142 York sill stands. The old Shanghai Village has since switched ownership, but is still a Chinese restaurant called Hunan Wok. The rest of the building is remains residential. It is owned by Elm City Partners; an off-campus real estate company affiliated with Yale, and has six units in the building. As you can see from the picture below, it remains as our only portal to a much different York Street.','[]','','c. 1868','[]','[]','','','142 York Street, New Haven, CT 06510','41.3074404','','[\'Preservation & Renewal towards Trowbridge Square\']','None');

Sadly, though 305 George St. officially no longer exists and was demolished in the early 20th century, the address can refer to the two building of the trio that remain.  These buildings have a uninterrupted history of religiously affiliated ownership: 301, 303, and 305 George St. began as the a church school, then became a Baptist church, next became a synagogue, and now is owned by the Salvation Army.  More precisely, Trinity Parish Church remained in the three buildings until 1911 when the building was changed to the Italian Baptist Church and the residence of the minister.  In 1923, the buildings became a synagogue for Congregation Tiferesafes Israel.  It remained as such until 1953 when the synagogue maintained ownership of 301 George St. but the Salvation Army obtained ownership of 303 and (the nonexistent) 305 George St.  Finally in 1954, Salvation Army obtained ownership of all three addresses.','[]','','1868-1869','[]','[]','Henry Austin','','305 George Street, New Haven, CT','41.3055493','','[\'Preservation & Renewal towards Trowbridge Square\']','None');

Built in 1922 by a contractor, F.C. Kusterer1, the building is described by the Connecticut Historical Resources Inventory [see Figure 5] as symmetrical colonial revival, “notable for its fine proportions and classical detail,”2 even though many of the decorations would be considered clumsy now. Nevertheless, Redclyffe fits comfortably into its surrounding Whitney Avenue neighborhood of institutional offices and other apartment buildings.

Before 245 Whitney was there, the site was a part of the Fellows estate, a large house and gardens that had been built by Richard Fellows, a Yale College alumnus and benefactor.3 As can be seen by archival photos [see Figure 2], this large estate, the house itself known as “Redcliffe”4, fit in well with a largely affluent neighborhood with similar homes along Whitney and the New Haven Lawn Club.5 In 1906, the last resident moved into the Fellows house, J. Davenport Wheeler, who was just returning from Paris. He had previously attended the Sheffield Scientific School, where he studied chemistry and geology, fought in the Civil War, and worked in New Haven as a partner in a hardware firm. Wheeler lived in “Redcliffe” until his death in 1922.

Upon Wheeler’s death, the land was subdivided [see Figures 3-4, the Sanborn maps]. The first thing built on this plot was 245 Whitney, sensibly named the “Redclyffe Apartments,” in April 1922. It cost $50,000 to build at the time and contained 6 units.6 In the 1920s, immediately after construction, the building catered to a high-end professional class, with two Yale professors and a Vice President of a downtown company living there.7

In the 1930s, in the middle of the Great Depression, the property changed hands from the original developer, Kusterer, to C.B. Walker, who in 1938 subdivided to create 8 apartments out of six.8 Sometime soon after, Walker defaulted on his mortgage and the building ended up in the hands of Second National Bank.9 In 1945, the bank sold the building to Jacob F. Buckman for $52,500;  Buckman incorporated “Redclyffe Inc.” to manage the building.10 By the 1960s, the tenant mix was changing somewhat: although it still contained two Yale professors and a physician, the building also housed two widows.11

After Mr. Buckman died, Mrs. Buckman and Redclyffe Inc. held the building for decades. After minimal records for years, they did renovation work in 1993.12 In addition, as the neighborhood increasingly became composed of students, the tenant mix changed as well. In April 1999, the property was actually sold to Quinnipiac University13, supposedly to use as (very afar) student housing. In the years that they owned it, until 2004, they did extensive repairs and upgrades, all totaling nearly $230,000.14

In April of 2004, Redclyffe Apartments was sold to its current owner, Matt Nemerson of Peabody Place, LLC.15 One of his first actions was to further subdivide the property, dividing one of the first-floor apartments into two, taking advantage of persistent student housing needs.16 There are now 9 apartments in this building. Soon after, he installed electric heat in all the apartments and improved wiring to the transformer in back, over $30,000.17 Peabody Place continues to own the current Redclyffe

Edward P. Evans Hall, designed by Norman Foster, lends Whitney Avenue a modern, glassy feel; once inside, it boasts a grassy courtyard, massive art installations, and state-of-the-art lecture facilities. But one cannot help sensing that a stately structure like 175 Whitney, with history, rather than computer monitors, embedded in its walls, would better fit with its surroundings.**</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>The three-story modern office building that currently stands at 155 Whitney Avenue was built in 1951 by the Security Insurance Company of New Haven and designed by New Haven architect Douglas Orr. The building is symmetrical and rectangular and built from limestone and marble with a structural system of iron and steel. It mirrors the size and scale of 175 Whitney which was built in 1924 for the Security Insurance Company of New Haven as the first commercial intrusion into a residential neighborhood. The landscaping in front of the building has a significant impact on the building’s relationship to the street. In a photograph taken in October of 1980 one can clearly see the lack of landscaping presenting a much starker street-view than the current building with landscaping. Landscaping also seems to have been on the mind of Douglas Orr as he conceptualized 155 and 175 Whitney Avenue as part of a larger “campus” for the Security Insurance Company of New Haven. A drawing found in the papers of Douglas Orr shows a “future building” standing to the south and completing a heavily landscaped headquarters complex. The property of 155 and 175 Whitney Avenue were owned by Frederick Wells Williams, professor of History at Yale. The Williams’ house, built in 1879, stood on the property at least until 1946 when the property was sold by Frances W. Williams, wife of Frederick, to the Security Insurance Company of New Haven for $125,000. The northern part of the property where 175 stands was purchased by the insurance company from the Williams’ in 1923. The current building was bought by Yale along with 175 Whitney in 1965 and currently houses the University’s Department of Human Resources. Douglas William Orr was a Yale trained architect who opened what was New Haven’s largest architectural firm during the middle of the 20th century. It began as a general practice and his early work was mostly residential. As the practice grew it became more institutional and commercial. Orr gained national recognition and served as the President of the American Institute of Architects in 1949. He retired in 1966. The building has become a subject of controversy as the Yale School of Management has plans to demolish both 155 and 175 Whitney Avenue to make way for a new building designed by Lord Norman Foster. The New Haven Preservation Trust has called upon Yale “to give serious consideration to reusing existing structures.” The Foster plans have yet to be presented, but it is unlikely they have taken the Preservation Trust’s words very seriously.</p>','[]','','1951','[]','[]','Douglas Orr','','155 Whitney Avenue, New Haven, CT 06511','41.315522','','[\'Industry & Luxury around Prospect Hill\']','None','[]','[]');

The building is now managed by C.A. White a commercial real estate development firm. The first two floors are currently occupied by Yale University, the third floor by Delio and Peterson an intellectual property patents, trademarks and copyright firm, and the fourth floor (penthouse) by Seely and Berglass a law firm. The office building that is situated at 121 Whitney Avenue at present was built in 1962 by Tenth Street Building Corporation of Erie (figure 1). The civil engineer and surveyor of the project was Charles A. Cahn.

121 Whitney Avenue is very unique in comparison to its next door neighbors because of its contemporary architectural style influenced by Mies van der Rohe (figure 2). The elevated simple metal and glass fronted building creates more space out of a small lot. According to Mies “less is more” which in this case proves to be true as space is created for both an office building and a parking lot (figure 3).

In order to fully appreciate the building that is now located at 121 Whitney Avenue a brief history of the property is necessary. In 1890 Wallace B. Fenn inherited 121 Whitney Avenue which was one of the four lots of Benjamin Thayer’s land (figure 4). However, in 1900 Fenn divided his land by a brick partition wall creating two separate lots (121 and 119 Whitney Ave.). He kept 119 for himself and gave Henrietta W. English 121 for free . By May of 1900 both L.H. English (husband of H.W. English) and W.B. Fenn received the permission to build two three story masonry buildings. By 1924 the two buildings had been converted into flats (Figure 5). However, according to the phone directory both buildings were occupied by one family until the 1930s: 119 by Julia S. Bristol and 121 by Lucius Storrs. While Julia Bristol continued to live in 119 Whitney Avenue until 1948; 121 Whitney Avenue was used as office spaces for mostly physicians until 1957. In 1957 the Whitney Development Company purchased 119 Whitney Avenue and by 1958 they had also purchased 121 Whitney Avenue (figure 6). In 1961 the two lots were sold to Tenth Street Building Corporation of Erie, officially remerging the two lots. Finally in 1962 as mentioned earlier the four-story office building was built (figure 7).

Since 1962 not much has been altered to the exterior or interior design of the building. The only minor noteworthy changes that have been made were in 2005. First the lobby and first floor common areas were renovated by Motor Inn Associates, LLC and finally the second floor was renovated by C.A. White in order to create office space and labs for Yale University.

In the last century 121 Whitney Avenue has gone through a lot of change both architecturally and tenant wise. However, its contemporary structure is very successful in that it accommodates the offices for the purpose of its use, efficiently.

The designers are New Haven architects Brown & Von Beren, who mostly did work on Prospect Hill. 

Shortly after the building opened a second permit was submitted on March 18th, 1925, to build a carriage house in the back of the lot for a price of $800.00. In 1998 a permit was filed for its demolition for an unspecified cost, by current owner Don Lord, who lives off the premises in Southport, Connecticut. Its value, however, was listed at $5,250.The next permit on record is from April 4th, 1946, when then owner Jacob Witkin planned to alter a single apartment unit for $400, possibly suggesting he may have lived there. On January 12, 1952, Witkin applied to “convert one basement apartment into living rooms for two families,” which may explain, however unclearly, when and how the number of apartment units grew to 28, which is otherwise first reflected in a 1987 building inspection that describes Brian Manor as a “28-unit apartment.” According to permits on file in the New Haven Hall of Records, there was a fire in unit 2B sometime in mid-2007. Three permits were filed to repair the damage, one to install new sheetrock, tenant separations, and smoke detectors for a cost of $8,000, filed on October 12th, an electrical permit filed on November 6th, and a plumbing permit filed on March 24th, 2008.

The building is a total 7,407 square feet on a 16,538 square foot lot. On the 75’ wide by 220’-6” deep lot, the building is set back 25’ from the right-of-way, 67’ from the rear property line, and 11’ from the west property line. The apartment is built right up to the eastern property line, and provides a recessed light-well for windows to apartments on that side. The total footprint is 64’ x 130’. The apartment is built with concrete footings over gravel, but has a stone-masonry foundation wall. A steel superstructure of 4 ½” x 5” “Lally Patent” columns forms a 9’-0” square grid. The exterior wall is solid masonry of 12” to 16” deep, and the interior partitions are unspecified but likely of stick construction. The estimated cost of the project at the time of the permit was $100,000.

Nevertheless its differing typology was not at all out of scale or out of context. Even while containing 24 units, it’s height of three-stories was consistent with the rest of the block, and the quaint, country-like Tudor bays on the front of the building match the suburban residential character that surrounds it. Furthermore, it is just one house away from the soaring stone masonry towers of the Plymouth Congregational Church, which would have been an institution in the neighborhood for many years, its construction dating back to the 1880s. The color and texture of the brick reinforce the urban setting of the church and fits the scale of its parish hall around the corner; however it does decisively box in the back-yard of the Victorian house in-between the church and the apartment. To date Brian Manor is the only property that was redeveloped as multi-family housing. Instead, the rest of the block became absorbed by growing sphere of influence of Saint Raphael Hospital across the street, changing use from residences to doctors’ offices and other support facilities. In the face of these changes, however, it has maintained its use as an apartment house.

The most important changes Brian Manor are not so much in its internal history but in its settings. Indeed, while the history of Brian Manor has been remarkably steady and consistent considering all of the massive changes across the street in the development of Saint Raphael Hospital. According to Sanborn Fire Insurance maps, in 1901 the south side of Chapel Street was of entirely residential housing stock, most likely in the surrounding Victorian style. At that time a different hospital occupied one of these houses, Grace Hospital, which was down the block to the west at 1418 Chapel Street. The next map, from just before when Brian Manor was built in 1924, the opposite side of the street was occupied by the New Haven Normal School of Gymnastics across several converted Victorian houses. Saint Raphael Hospital occupied only a single deep building directly across the street from Brian Manor, at the address 1442 Chapel Street. It was neighbored then, to the west, by the much larger Grace Hospital, which, like the gymnastics school, occupied several converted buildings across many sites. The next available map in 1973  shows a radical transformation in that block. No single building remained from 1924, and the entire block had been consolidated into a single property under Saint Raphael Hospital. The plans show the beginnings of the organism that is current, built-up, dense complex, though in 1973 much of the Chapel Street frontage is un-built and used as surface parking. Since that last mapping, almost all houses along Chapel Street in that area have been converted to doctors’ offices, pharmacies, and other facilities relating to the now major hospital. The residential program of Brian Manor, however, has remained virtually unaffected by all of these changes.

The edifice comprised 31 residences: 4 one bedroom, 11 two-bedroom, 9 three-bedroom and 7 five-bedroom apartments.

In 1972, maximum rental fees had been capped at $199 for the five-bedroom suites and decreased proportionately to $175, $152 and, on the low end, $129 for one-bedroom accommodations. With the high and low of those numbers comparable to less than $950 + $600 today, respectively, the initial ideal of housing low- to median income families seems almost reasonable. At the time, it was likely a welcome addition to available housing options. Across the street from a school and adjacent to a park, it was likely attractive for the same reasons the neighborhood had been as far back as 1886.

The allure of the idyllic single-family home, however, had been replaced by a challenging piece of architecture that likely had very few familiar traits in the eyes of potential tenants. Designed by Milford, CT architect David Travers (to whom no other area buildings are easily attributed), the cinderblock and poured concrete construction is an anomaly, objectively owing something to the functionality of bunker and military architecture and to the flexible modularity of systems like that of Le Corbusier’s Chandigarh projects.

Navigating the then-awkward balance between public and private spheres, the co-op was built with its most noticeable and notable feature — a system of modular fence/railing/ wall pieces — creating literal barriers to the realms outside itself. Each staircase was edged with them, each balcony used them as its railing, even the several first-floor apartments with the luxury of a miniature front lawn had these cast monoliths in place of the proverbial picket fence.','New Haven Redevelopment Agency','[\'Residential\']','[]','[\'Modernist\']','[]','Provenance + Forebears

On the 1911 New Haven Atlas, the property now occupied by 206-266 Day Street — more or less a single, immense structure — was split up into twelve nearly equal residential plots that spanned the block between Chapel Street and Edgewood Avenue.

Day Street, oriented North/South and running parallel to Dwight and Kensington Streets, could very well have been made an archetypal neighborhood of single-family homes. Good portions of the more southern parts of the avenue appear on surveyor’s maps as early as 1886 and denote a history of a dense but partitioned residential community that likely pursued a suburban ideal with relative proximity to the New Haven Green and Downtown.

The character of the block and the larger Dwight Street neighborhood remained much the same through the first half of the 1900s and during the relative prosperity of the Second World War. The post-war boom resonated in New Haven as it did in many Northeastern cities.

Background of Urban Renewal

By the middle of the century, however, industrial weakening and a mass movement to the growing suburbs of the city had left New Haven — especially the downtown areas — in noticeable decline. By 1954, then-mayor Richard C. Lee had begun some of the earliest major urban renewal projects in the US, and the New Haven Redevelopment Agency — a government-sponsored entity — would be responsible for hundreds of ground-up revitalization projects across the city in the following two decades.

Germination + Construction.

Following several major additions to the urban fabric of New Haven (including the completion of nearby Interstate 91), priorities for the city’s renewal shifted from transportation to habitation, and plans for several units of affordable downtown housing were prepared.

Certain areas became the focus of more intense programming, among them the Dwight Street neighborhood, which included several blocks of Day Street. By 1965, plans were in place for low- to median-income housing that would ultimately replace the twelve single-family homes that ran the length of the block between Chapel and Edgewood. On June 28th, 1966, the last of the twelve units was sold to the New Haven Redevelopment Agency, which  paid each of the homeowners $15,000-16,000 (equivalent to $95,000-102,000 in 2007) for the residences and the land on which they stood. Soon thereafter, the houses were vacated and taken down.

Under Section 236 of the National Housing Act, construction on the Antillean Manor at 206-266 Day Street began in July, 1970 and came to characterize the Dwight Renewal Project. The building cost the NHRA $759,200 ($4 million in 2007), and the first families were moving into the new housing by winter of 1972/73.

','','<p>Built by the New Haven Redevelopment Agency in 1972 as an affordable housing cooperative, the Antillean Manor is a 4-story structure of cinder blocks and poured concrete.</p>','[]','The wall system visually unifies the building (actually a composition of five units separated by three covered carports that provide access to the rear parking lot) by extending itself down the entire length of the block-long facade. It’s horizontality (due both to architectural styling and sheer length) is most striking when seen from Chapel street; viewed obliquely in this way, the building hardly has an end and tends to act as its own vanishing point.

Painted white, with the exception of the beige-brown partition system, the effect of the massive structure — 31 units, four stories, 33,128 sq. ft. of living area — is softened somewhat by the elimination of its naturally gray construction color. Nevertheless, it remains an imposing structure.

Monumental and peculiar though it may be, the construction is decidedly inhabited: the Antillean Manor at 206-266 Day Street exists and functions today much as it did thirty-seven years ago, housing approximately thirty low- to median-income individuals, couples and families. Whether or not it will continue to operate in this manner is, of course, uncertain.

While the flat-roofed building is solid and sound, the school across the street has since ceased operations.  In this writer\'s view, the tone of the neighborhood is a depressed one, suggesting that the Dwight Renewal and Redevelopment Area is again in need of, if not renewal and/or redevelopment, then, at the very least, some sort of resuscitation.

Two story brick building possibly mixed commercial office

According to New Haven Sanborn maps, the lot now currently reserved for the Temporary Labor office was a small house under the name A.E. Stevens as early as 1911. The current brick building seems to have been built in 1924 under the ownership of Elisa Milano as retail space on the first floor with two apartments or offices on the second floor. Over its life permits and remodelings have been issued under specific addresses suggesting that it original intention for mixed used was maintained even when it was purchased by New Haven Savings Bank in 1936. Under ownership of I. Himmel individual incidents of alteration were never isolated to one address. In little over a year almost every unit sought a permit. It was later purchased by the Yale surgical Company, a small medical supply store. It seems the company moved to627 Chapel after a few alterations to the building in 1968. In the 80s the first floor became a restaurant under ownership of Luigi Bernardo. It is interesting to note that in later permits ownership is listed as Gigi Pizza. It is no longer a restaurant. The latest permits tell us that a beautify parlor and a liquor store flanked the still existing Temporary Labor office. Today only the Office seems to remain. It is assumed that the second floor is houses two offices. The middle door has the shared address 1295‐93. The intercolumniation, however, is so narrow that the entry must be a shared vestibule and that up a flight of stairs are separate doors for each office.

The earliest known use for 830 Grand ave was Orchowsky Meat Co in 1916 until sometime in the early 1930s. After Orchowsky Meat moves out the building remains vacant until 1961 when It housed  Chevron Ties Inc for three years before Tudor House Furniture and Upholsterers Moves in from 1964 till the late 1969.

While 832 was briefly used as a clothing store in 1920.  In 1921 H.M. Bullard is the first owner to appear in the building permits and alters the storefront and 832 is occupied by Household Furniture from then till the late 1950s. During that ownership H.M Bullard made several alterations to the storefront and the building including erecting a warehouse and in 1947 erecting an elevator shaft. Between 1956 and 1957 832 Grand changed ownership from H.M. Bullard to Bradley Smith Confectioners Company. Bradley Smith Alters the storefront in 1957 and occupies the building till 1984.  Bradley Smith Company started as a candy production company. The original owner patented the lollypop with a y, however after some time the spelling changed to use an I instead. Eventually the company changed hands while keeping the original name, however switched to more of a wholesale distribution company.

Beginning in 1969 830 remained listed as vacant or no listing at all in the city directory until1985 when Phillip Sweedler perform major renovations in 1985. It seems that this was when the two properties were merged into one continuous storefront. These renovations included general interior repairs building of 5 offices, 3 restrooms, a large showroom and two storage rooms. The building was repointed along with the addition of a side vestibule, an exterior loading dock among many others.  After these alterations 830 housed Nationwide Liquidators. In 1990 Norman Sweedler had alterations done to the 2nd, 3rd and 4th floors to be used by Connecticut probation offices including handicap accessibility, fire safety improvements  along with installing one elevator to serve all four floors. At this time Project More moves in but does not purchase the building until 1997.

The latter is rarely mentioned even though the building historically had multiple retail/residential occupants. The current occupants, Joseph’s Furs, “the furtive furrier,” and Thomas M Brandt Bail Bondsman, use “1193 Chapel” to locate their respective businesses. Joseph’s Furs has resided on Chapel Street since 1909, according to an article in The New Journal, a Yale undergraduate publication, and seems to have shared the wood-frame structure with various other businesses and residents throughout the century, most prominently, doctor’s offices.

From 1907-1913, Stuart Ernest Skiff, MD had a medical practice in the house. He then moved next door to 1194 Chapel. Another doctor, Charles W. Comfort, resided in the house. He served in WW1, performing first aid on the front lines; for this work, he won a medal of honor and an oak leaf. Dr. Comfort acted as Secretary to the Connecticut State Medical Society, around 1920.

The original date of construction varies from source to source. An online appraisal company claims the construction dates to 1900, whereas the current ground floor occupant, Joseph’s Furs, says 1813. A building permit from 1906 describes a “roof change and alterations,” therefore the 1900 date is unlikely. There are no more documented alterations until 1948, when it was re-sided for insulation purposes. Thereafter, the alteration permits relate primarily to the retailer Joseph’s furs and their storefront. In 1954, they officially converted the first floor into a store and built the masonry addition on the front. Ten years later, a fireproof storage vault was constructed in the rear; interior alterations took place a few months later. The storefront was remodeled one last time in 1983, presumably to its current state: brick with aluminum and glass infill.

The fur retailer provides fodder for much speculation and lore among current and past Yale students due to the daily change of furs on pedestals in the storefront coupled with the apparent lack of business and/or owners. (In fact, I have never seen one person enter or exit the store in the last 18 mos.) One can only assume that the unusual circumstances surrounding Joseph’s Furs led to the article to the article, “A Furtive Endeavor,” in The New Journal. In documenting an interview with the owner, Fred Joseph, and his wife, Selma, Jordan Jacks describes the habits of retailers who live in fear of robbery and propagate rumors about the history of the building. It seems that their fur vault, a windowless 1-sotry structure accessed through the back wall of the first floor store was robbed in 1959, following an apparent renovation by Joseph, the younger (his father was the first owner, and apparently bought the house in the “early 20th Century.”) The thieves drilled 86 holes in a weak spot of the vault and stole dozens of furs. This renovation also turned up rumors, as Joseph found feminine items in the walls which led him to believe that it may once have been a brothel. Despite the claim of a 1959 renovation, the permits are not on file. There is, however, documentation of multiple smaller renovations and additions, including the vault and the storefront – the two most identifiable parts of the building as they are appendages to a vernacular wood-frame mansard building and represent of the apparent need for security and privacy in fur retailing.','[]','','1813','[\'Chapel West\']','[]','','','1193 Chapel Street, New Haven, CT','41.3092326','','[\'Westward through Dwight Edgewood\']','None');

A contract found in the Yale Archives from February 26, 1919 describes how Louis H. Levy acquired the property and its building as part of the will and estate of Andrew R. Bradley. The gift of the property to Mr. Levy included the burdens of a $12,000 outstanding mortgage. According to the “Medical Review of Reviews” of 1917 (found by searching Google Books), Louis Henry Levy was a prominent Gastroenterologist.

A building permit issued by the city of New Haven on September 7th, 1921 to Dr. Louis H. Levy describes plans for the building that still occupies 1172 Chapel Street. The architect, J. Weinstein, with an office at 6 Church Street, planned a three-story building with two ground-level stores and fourteen apartments above. The building is 4800 square feet in footprint and wholly fills the 54’-8” street frontage. The building will have concrete footings, a stone foundation wall, and brick walls above grade. The roof will be flat, made out of slag, and have a metal cornice. The estimated cost of the building, including its steam heating system, is listed at $70,000.

This new building is of a larger, urban scale not yet present in much of the neighborhood. It was one of the first to change from the single-family-home typology to a block-filling type. This perhaps helped spur the rest of the neighborhood to further and denser development; such anticipated development, as evidenced by the present state of buildings of the neighborhood, never fully occurred.

Another contract found in the Yale Archives from October 30, 1926 indicates that Louis H. Levy sold the property and his new building to the Parker-Smith Company for $119,000. The Parker-Smith Company took out a mortgage with the Second National Bank to purchase the property.


Another document in the Yale Manuscripts &amp; Archives collection from June 27, 1946, indicates that the property and building, then known as the Medical Arts Building – perhaps indicating a number of medical practices present in the ground-floor commercial spaces—had been sold from owner Second National Bank to the Municipal Realty Corporation for $73,000. Perhaps the Second National Bank had acquired the property through foreclosure on the previous owner.

A 1949 insurance policy statement for the building from the Layer’s Title Insurance Company describes that the owner, Municipal Realty Corporation, has taken out an insurance policy for $140,000. Municipal Realty must also own the adjacent 1176 Chapel, as the insurance policy lists the tenants as a 3-year lease to a Michael Cunningham and a 10-year lease to a Justin Mercuria, who ran “Jesse’s Epicure Shoppe.” Unfortunately, the tenants of 1172 Chapel were not specifically listed.

A contract from 1951 found at the Yale Archives indicates that both 1172 and 1166 Chapel were sold to Herman T. Perry for the sum of one dollar. Perhaps this indicates that the property and neighborhood had become blighted and that this low price was part of an intention urban renewal of the area. Another contract found from September of the same year describes a lease to .Sullivan’s Restaurant, presumably in its present location of 1166 Chapel.

According to a building permit from August 16, 1982, the owner of the 1172 Chapel at the time was “1166 Chapel Street, Inc.,” apparently a subsidiary of Ripps Realty of New Haven. At that time, they were applying for a permit to convert unused office space to an apartment.

An archivist’s summary of the history of this building indicates that a new owner took out a $300k mortgage for the building on May 15, 1984. Visionappraisal.com indicates that this date is when present owner William S. Esposito of East Haven purchased the building. Esposito is mentioned in a number of other building permits for the adjoining buildings on Chapel Street; a search on Visionappraisal reveals that Esposito is a major landowner in New Haven, owning 20 buildings within the city. The fact that he chose to rename 1172 Chapel after himself perhaps indicates that this was one of his first acquisitions or that he found something significant about this building that he did not in his other properties.


The current appraisal listed at Visionappraisal indicates the building has 14,854 square feet of living area, an assessed value of $744,800 and a replacement cost of $1,519,796. The assessment does, however, incorrectly list the date of construction as 1900 and somewhat incorrectly lists the address simply as 1170 Chapel Street.

As of February 2009, the long-term ground-floor tenants on Chapel Street remain Chap’s Grille and Pad Thai Restaurant. Together with the restaurants Sullivan’s, to the east in adjoining building 1166 Chapel, and Est Pizza Ristorante, to the west in adjoining building 1174-1176 Chapel, they form a small but dense and bustling corridor of commercial activity. All owned by Esposito, this is one of the westernmost outposts of the Yale community and perhaps acts as neutral ground between university and city.

The size and shape of the building in plan makes it appear to be, at least typologically, a single-family home. 

According to a survey map from 1950, the building actually occupies both addresses 1170 and 1172 Chapel Street. In this survey, both of the current adjoining buildings are already present.

YMCA national was founded in 1851 and arrived in New Haven fifteen years later in 1866. Their first building was erected on Temple Street and their operations quickly expanded with four more branches sprouting in New Haven, including one at Yale’s Dwight Hall in 1910. The New Haven Historical Society records say that the YMCA purchased four houses on the corner of Howe and Chapel Streets in 1919 and erected a central branch for their New Haven operations on the site in 1924. However, it appears this information may be faulty. The White Brothers’ title searches for this site show that the YMCA purchased it from Henry P. Sage on May 28, 1921. Additionally, there is a plaque above the main entrance of the building that dates it to 1922. In any event, this building fronts on Chapel Street and not Howe. However, it appears that the Historical Society was correct in their assessment that this central branch had a swimming pool and gymnasium. The western façade has glass block windows on the ground level (typical for a swimming pool) and has metal grating in front of the windows on the fourth floor (typical for a gymnasium).

The building fronting on Howe Street has a cornerstone dating it to 1931. This corner building, 52-56 Howe Street, seems to be on the land of four houses, as shown by Sanborn Maps and the White Brothers’ record. It was the last building of the YMCA complex that was built, completed just two years after the YWCA to its south, and is the most ornate and impressive of the three, signaling the strength of the financial support of the New Haven community. It seems that the building was a center for social activities in the Howe Street Neighborhood, not only for the youth, but also for young adults. At the New Haven Historical Society, I was regaled by the historian who fondly remembered going to dances there when soldiers returned home from World War II. The building maintained its status as the anchor of the community through the 1980s.

In 1986, a group of community activists called the Upper Chapel Neighborhood Improvement Association gathered in the building and drew up a plan for “Chapel West,” a special services district. The district lines Chapel Street and Howe Street with the YMCA as its core (see map). Together, they drew up plans for providing security for the neighborhood, bringing investors in, providing a new image for the neighborhood, and maintaining clean streets, parks and buildings.

Currently, the headquarters for Chapel West are across the street. In the early 1990s, the YMCA’s operation shrank to a small recessed part of the building in between the YMCA and the YWCA. The building is now called the “Village West Apartments” and contains 148 “efficiency apartments,” small studios, each with a kitchenette and bathroom. This last renovation occurred in 2002, and maintained the beautiful wood paneling covering the walls of the first floor. Whatever becomes of the building next, it will surely maintain its historical significance as the YMCA, the center of the Chapel West Neighborhood.','[]','','1931','[\'Chapel West\']','[]','Douglas Orr','','52 Howe Street, New Haven, CT','41.3091097','','[\'Historic Chapel West and Dwight Edgewood\']','None');

Today, both help to satisfy the desire for affordable and student housing but as the property upon which these buildings stand were once three separate lots, each has a separate and distinct past.

The earliest record that I could find on either property dates from 1891. In that year, Henry K. Beach, who already owned property at 86 Howe, purchased the lot at 82 Howe Street. Two years later, in November of 1893, a New Havener named J. Willis Downs spent $9000 constructing a 2.5 story frame house next door to Beach’s property at 80 Howe Street. According to the Sanborn maps, this new property was built out of brick, an element which no doubt brought variety to a row of wood framed houses. Along the way, Beach sold his parcel at 82 Howe to a man named C.S. Redfield for in 1905, Redfield is listed as having built a two-story frame barn on that lot.

By 1911, Beach and Redfield retained ownership on their properties but 80 Howe changed possession once again. Max Miller, secretary of the Warner Miller Co. Railroad Supply, held that property for a couple of years before selling it to Edward and Emma Clundt who then sold it to the Debussy, Kusterer Co. (a real estate firm) in 1926.

In 1928, a contractor named Frank Rubino took out a building permit on 80-82 Howe Street in order to build a 71 occupant apartment tenement costing about $160,000. This structure still stands today. In the 1930s, the 80 Howe Apartments were managed by the City controller, Arthur D. Moller. They were “efficiency apartments,” home to a wide variety of middle-class and professionals from nurses to city clerks. Construction next door at 84 Howe St., which would become a 77 unit apartment building, began a year later (1929). Despite some minor repairs, an update to the roof structure, heating system and, telecommunications system, neither building has really changed significantly since construction almost eighty years ago. Today, the 80 Howe apartments are managed by the Chelsea Company and 84 Howe, known as the “Campus View apartments,” is managed by C.A. White.','[]','','1928','[\'Dwight-Edgewood\']','[]','','','80-86 Howe Street, New Haven, CT','41.3107256','','[\'Historic Chapel West and Dwight Edgewood\']','None');

Architecturally speaking, it appears, you also can’t judge a building by its facade: at least not the building at 29-45 Broadway in New Haven, CT. Which building? you might ask, and you’d be well within reason. A casual stroll down Broadway today includes passing by the three aesthetically distinct yet proportionally similar edifices that house the retail stores Urban Outfitters, Kixters, Origins and J Crew. Architecturally the three facades could not be more different; one an orange brick front with three arched bays reminiscent of an old urban firehouse, the next an intricate composition of patterned red brick and ionic capped pilasters, and the third a modern storefront of aluminum and glass. And yet, this tripartite arrangement is, literally, hiding something greater than its composite parts might suggest.

The truth, of course, is that these three distinct facades are nothing more than ornamental applications to the front of what is, ultimately, a single building. This clever design solution is the product of a collaboration between Yale University and the Chicago-based firm Hammond, Beeby, Rupert Ainge (HBRA) Architects. Some time between 1999 and early 2000, Yale University embarked on redeveloping a large portion of the Broadway area near the intersection with York Street into an upscale retail cluster suited to the desires of its considerable student population and their stash of (presumably) disposable income. The resultant piece of urban fabric succeeds on two levels. First, rather than imposing one gigantic facade onto the big box behind, HBRA intelligently partitioned the front elevation into the three distinct parts, picking up on the historical scale and rhythm of the existing street. Secondly, each architectural face corresponds to a single (or two smaller in one case) retail store, allowing each design to become a kind of architectural signage associated with the specific tenant that occupies the space behind it. In this way, architecture becomes an aesthetic component of the branding for that specific company.

While the use of three facades on a single building might seem a bit disingenuous, it does create a fairly accurate representation of the history of this New Haven site. According to the series of historical atlases and Sanborn Maps going back as far as 1886, the site currently occupied by the big building with three little facades was historically arrayed with a collection of smaller structures housing a variety of programs, from the private estate of WT Reynolds to paint stores and cigar shops. Though documentation for the site is scarce prior to 1886, the plot was likely home to the small private homes typical of the surrounding area prior to its development into a commercial strip in the 1900s. The 1911 map is indicative of this transition, showing a layout comprised of smaller masonry structures with the wood-framed estate of Mr. Reynolds weaving delicately between them. Jumping ahead to the survey of 1924, a more regularized pattern of parti-wall structures emerges, each with a distinct face which engages the street front along Broadway. While distinct points of entry, these facades created a larger urban wall which operated at the scale of the city itself.

Though the tenancy has undergone extensive turnover in the years between 1924 and 1999 , the relative composition of the built structures remained the same. During a short phase between 1999 and 2001, as Yale was initiating its redevelopment, most of the plots were listed as vacant (likely indicating demolition and construction that led to the current building), although Quality Wine Shop, the tenant occupying 35 Broadway since as early as 1974, seems to have held out as long as possible before relenting to the new wave of construction. Ultimately, of course, Yale succeeded in its attempt to redevelop Broadway and revitalize its reputation as an upscale retail venue. Despite its reincarnation, however, that big building with its many faces still alludes to the long history and scale of the site on which it now sits.','[]','','2001','[\'Broadway\']','[]','HBRA Architects, Chicago, IL','','29-45 Broadway New Haven, CT','41.3113094','','[\'Dynamic Broadway District\']','None');

There are, however, some interesting trends in the types of occupants that seem to correlate with New Haven’s historical changes and development. Before analyzing the chart of the tenants I want to note that the building has several addresses: 1050, 1052, 1054, 1056, 1058, 1060, 1062, and 1064 Chapel Street. 1056 Chapel is assigned to the second story of the building and the rest of the numbers represent separate storefronts on the ground floor.
According to the city’s directories from 1887 to 1924, the Yale Fruit Store and Frank Roberts, a dentist, occupied the second story of an older structure on the site. But between 1924 and 1925, a drastic change occurred and the previous occupants of the second story seemed to have to vacated the structure. Furthermore, the building expanded and thirteen units were available for rent instead of two. But only four of these new units are occupied. The new tenants were Red Top Cab Company, Eck Tailors, Cravagan Eleanor Millinery, and Dutee Wilcox Flint Incorporation (Dutee Wilcox Flint - a Rhode Island State Senator and business magnate). Moreover, 1050 and 1060 Chapel also became vacant. Only Moore S H Co florist at 1054, Glouskin & Fox jewelers at 1058, and the State restaurant at 1064 remained at their places. The change of occupancy most likely followed changes in the structure. New Haven’s directories suggest that the new building was constructed not in 1923 but a year later.
For the next twenty years tailors, dentists, and photographers were the primary occupants of the new building. Some of them left in a couple of years while others lingered longer. The Christian Science Reading Room remained in one of the sections on the ground floor for approximately 10 years and moved a couple of blocks down the street by the 1950s.
At the same time another big change occured. The main street of New Haven registered the nationwide shift in cities ignited by extensive highway construction and the automobile boom. U. S. Motors employment office, General Motors Acceptance Corp Finance Co., Car & Truck Leasing Co. Inc., Jaycee Fleet Leasing Corp. replaced tailors and dentists at 1056 and remained present at this address until the 1970s when the automobile industry shrunk and the building became vacant once again.
In 1977, well-known architect César Pelli became the Dean of the Yale School of Architecture and founded his architecture firm in New Haven. Soon, César Pelli Architects moved in to the 1056 Chapel and took up the entire second story of the building.
The architecture firm is still there today. Interestingly, the composition of the rest of the businesses in the building has returned to its origins. The types of occupants, two art galleries, a gift store, a Panera Bread Bakery and Enson’s menswear store, are similar to ones that were there back in 20s and 30s.','','[\'Commercial\']','[]','[]','[]','In an image from the Dana archive in the New Haven Museum dated 1923, the current building is present on the site for the first time. A Sanborn map from 1923 confirms that the building’s construction was likely completed during this year. On this map the plan of the building is glued over a plan of the previous structure on the site, suggesting it is unlikely that the building was constructed earlier than 1923.','','1050 Chapel Street, a two-story Art Deco structure built in the early 20th century, has long served New Haven’s commercial history. At the corner of Chapel and High streets, the building has housed a rich variety of businesses including flower shops and restaurants to dentist offices and truck insurance companies.
','[]','The building exemplifies a number of typical characteristics of the Art Deco style. Its façade is divided into eight rectangular blocks arranged in geometric fashion. A narrow entrance to the upper floor, squeezed in the middle of these blocks, divides the building into two halves. A wide band of glass stretches out horizontally reinforcing the streamlined appearance. The design of the façade is guided by straight lines rather than curved lines that unusually appear in another modern style - Art Nouveau. A steel frame is most likely the core structural element of the building. On the outside it is covered with smooth grey stone. The design of the building represents the scientific progress of the early 20th century and the subsequent rise of commerce, technology, and speed.
Built in 1923, the edifice is one of the earliest examples of commercial Art Deco architecture in America. The style became more widespread in the United Stated only in late twenties following the impact of the International Exposition of Modern Industrial and Decorative Arts in Paris in 1925.
There are several visually similar commercial structures in New Haven and in Connecticut. One in New Haven, located on Orange Street, was built in 1926 while another in Torrington was constructed in 1930.

The plaque in current Trowbridge Square reads that in 1834 Jocelyn transferred the title to the local African Americans.

In 1870 the building was acquired by Thomas Trowbridge and later taken over by his 5 sons when he died in 1882. In 1924 Brown and Von Beren redesigned the former wood framed school house, as indicated by Sanborn maps, into the brick structure you see today, adding a basketball court within its U shaped design.

City directories indicate that the building was called Spireworth School until 1949 when the lot had 2 addresses listed as 158 Spireworth School and 160 Trowbridge Recreation Center named after the civic minded Thomas Trowbridge reflecting the socially conscious intention that persisted throughout the neighborhood’s history.  

Documents from the Connecticut Historical Commission indicate as a threat to the building: “Deterioration of neighborhood”, which given the current state of the building may provide insight to the current economic state of the area as well as the interdependent relationship of the building to the immediate community.

These two structures are connected but were built separately, the section abutting Howe street in 1928 (1217-1227), and the other part in 1947 (1203-1215). Upon closer examination, it is obvious that the two were designed by different architects, since the former has an eclectic gothic-inspired feel and the latter a modern, mid-20th-century form.

Even so, both edifices replaced single family homes from the 19th century and represented a suburbanization of New Haven’s residents, as people moved further and further from the city’s traditional downtown core. The small strip, with two stories (retail on the bottom and offices on top), allowed from the growing neighborhoods on upper Chapel easier access to simple conveniences, which the buildings’ original lessors provided.

The progression of history has meant changes in the makeup of the stores that have occupied the street front windows. Original residents included beauty shops, dentists, a fur shop, an optician, and a drug store. Over time, those merchants were replaced with food providers, including a deli and a candy shop, and, in the 1980s, a Japanese restaurant (now on Howe Street) and a cafe. National chains entered, as well. These details are presented on the right panel.

Together, according to the city’s assessor’s office, the buildings are worth well more than a million dollars, which suggests that this section of Chapel Street is on the upswing. In the 1970s - perhaps in replication of the national trend of disinvestment in inner cities - over half of the storefronts in these particular buildings. Today, it is likely that hardship for the buildings’ owner (Schaffer Associates, whose offices are in the later structure) is a relic of the past.

But certainly the buildings’ use will change dramatically in the next half century, especially as Yale continues its sprawling growth into the Dixwell neighborhood. The University’s new sculpture building’s construction cranes frame these 20th century edifices, and make them seem smaller than they might have appeared in the past. Yale’s expansion means that New Haven’s central business district has extended its tendrils this far up Chapel Street, and it is unclear whether or not these buildings will soon outlive their usefulness. It is probably only a matter of time before Yale concludes that the land is too valuable for such a small shopping strip as the one described here.','[]','','1928, 1947','[\'Chapel West\']','[]','','','1203-1227 Chapel Street, New Haven, CT','41.3094038','','[\'Historic Chapel West and Dwight Edgewood\']','None');

Blackman lived in Oxford, CT, where he had a successful career in the carriage industry. This ended, however, in 1870, when he moved on to real estate.

The building is an example of a late 19th century commercial block with early 20th century additions. It is one of the first speculative commercial buildings on upper Chapel Street and paved the way for commercial intrusions in that area. Upper Chapel Street, known at that time as West Chapel Street, was not a commercial area. Though Chapel was an important thoroughfare in New Haven even at that time, it was not built up farther West than High Street at that time.

The building itself is a four-story masonry commercial building. The building is made of brick, cut stone, and wood frame bays supported by a wood frame and load-bearing masonry. The Chapel Street width is four bays wide by six bays wide on its length down York Street; the shape of the building is trapezoidal due to the shape of the site. The building’s slightly pitched shed roof is covered with roll asphalt and capped by a mutulary cornice. The fenestration on the Chapel Street façade features three tall canted bay windows rising from the second to the fourth floor. The windows are wood-framed clad in metal with paneled bases and transoms. The northeast corner is also canted and has single window openings, while the east side on York Street has single and canted bay openings.

Four storefronts make up the ground floor of the Blackman building, with residential apartment space above. Notable occupants of building include C. F. Kutscher Co., a manufacturer of confections, root beer, and ice cream established in 1883. Yale Pharmacy also occupied one of these storefronts beginning in 1881 by Henry S. Higby. The Pharmacy sold toilet articles, fancy goods, and patent medicines, was a popular establishment on Chapel Street. In the first half of the 20th century the storefronts were filled with a druggist, Norman and Markus Cigars, and a stationary store, among other things. The 1960s and ‘70s saw changes such as a shoe repair shop, a liquor store, a bookstore, and a restaurant. A fire in 1977 led to renovations in 1981 and left the spaces vacant until 1983.

1126-1134 Chapel Street is no occupied by three establishments: Book Trader Café, Luciana Padua Clothing Store, and Bangkok Gardens Restaurant. Book Trader is a café and used bookstore that has been in operation for eight years where students and locals linger over lunch and reading both in the light, glass-enclosed interior and in the gated outdoor seating area. The manager of Book Trader told me that, before they moved into the space, it had been empty, and had previously been occupied by Ashley’s Ice Cream.

According to a 1911 permit at the New Haven Department of Buildings, the building is 69 feet tall, 90 feet deep, and 27 feet wide. The State Street frontage features large, floor length windows, while the Eld Street façade reflects a more traditional residential building. These two entrances reflect a separation between the commercial/retail tenant space , isolated to the first two floors from the residential units in the rear and above. The upper floor windows on all of the buildings walls sit on cut stone sills, and feature brick segmental arches. They follow a standard pattern on the Eld Street façade, yet the southern façade windows are scattered in respect to the particularities of a building that stood across a narrow alley for most of 780 State street’s life. This building disappears sometime between its documentation on the 1973 Sanborn map and a Historic Building Inventory in 1982. 780’s roof is flat and made of tin, and features a main cornice with raised brick detailing at the top of the sixth floor.

The lot was sold to John B. Wright in January of 1890 from the estate of Richard T. Merwin. The current building had been constructed prior to Wright’s death in 1892, at which point Rachel Wright acquired it from his estate. “The first known occupant of the structure was O. Scott Wright, whose stove, furnace and plumbing business as listed at this address from 1891 through 1905. The 1901 Sanborn map identifies this as a Tin Shop, which operated throughout O. Scott Wright’s ownership, until he sold it to Morris M. Pucklin in 1924. In 1926, the space was leased to the Davis Manufacturing and Sales Company, who manufactured, assembled, and sold musical instruments and accessories. Other uses, as indicated on the title transactions and the Sanborn maps, include “Aircraft Radio Industries” in the late 40s and 50s, and later an upholstery company.

It is evident that light industry has dominated the commercial usage of this building, until renovations in the 70s converted the upper floors to loft residential units. A review of the records at the Department of Buildings shows the permits for additions and interior alterations dating as far back as O. Scott Wright’s occupation. The floor plans for the upper floors show a great deal of variance over time, indicating the flexibility of the structure in its uses. The area around 780 has historically been home to similar light industry, although this particular building is one of the taller structures in the area. As New Haven developed and industry was pushed further out along State street, the turn to residential tenants is reflective of a changing neighborhood dynamic, reflected in the similar conversion of other turn of the century buildings in the area. The current owner, Bob Frew, is a prominent property owner in the area, and acquired many of his properties through government auction at great discount in the 1980s. As of 2015, the current tenant is Vacancy Busters, an apartment rental agency for the New Haven area.

The building is constructed in the Queen Anne style, and features a 6 bay, 4 entry façade plan and a ridge-to-street gable roof. The first known tenant, August Schwermann, moved here in 1891, and ran saloon on the first floor while living with his wife in an apartment upstairs. Schwermann relocated his home and business to West Haven in 1912, and by 1913 the ground floor shops were home to a bakery (owned by Frank O’Connell) and another saloon (owned by Jacob G. Rausch). The tenants living in the upper floor apartments ranged from laborers to a widow to the men who ran the businesses below. In the 1920s and 1930s various individuals and businesses (e.g. an undertaker and an upholsterer, though the shops were mostly vacant in the post-Depression era) occupied parts of the building, until finally, in 1940, the arrival of the 6 member Citerella family and the opening of The People’s Cleaner ushered in a period of tenant stability that lasted around 15 years. Edward’s Lunch opened up shop in the early 1960s and persevered through to the early 1980s, despite widespread vacancies both in the building itself and the neighborhood around.

The design was realized by Rapid Construction Company of New Haven and the roof is supported by steel I-beams, which are attached on the outside of the roof, giving the ceiling a floating effect. Interestingly enough, even at its inception, the building has been under threat of demolition, be it due to the city of New Haven wanting to replace it with the on-ramp to Interstate 91 (1966) or due to the riots related to the Black Panther Trials (1970.) In spite of these threats, the building still stands today, unique because of it\'s iconic floor to ceiling glass façade, its architectural bronze I-beams and roof, and the fact that it remains occupied by the same family who opened the business originally.

He bought this property with the intention of developing it and selling it for a profit, as was common of property bought at this time in this neighborhood. He promptly sold all three in 1866. The National Register calls the collective cluster the "Broomhead-Alling House." Today, each home is in the Second Empire style, measuring about 2 stories with a wood frame, with a 24\' wide by 48\' deep footprint and a cut stone foundation.  Mansard roofs were added circa 1865, and a first story commercial front and connecting frame wing was added to 846 State circa 1900.

In 1886, the deed transferred from Broomhead to single owners (850 and 842 to Robert Alling and 846 to Lavinia van Duzer). In the early 1900’s the buildings\' respective programs became more varied, hosting a store, a single family, and a tailor shop. By the mid 1900’s they were adapted to hold multiple families (842 hosted three families, while 846 hosted four, and two dwelt in 850. By the mid twentieth century, 842 remained a store, while 846 was divided into three apartments and 850 was split into four plus a tailor shop. Today, the buildings house a hair salon, a tax office and residences in the upper floors.

A Note on Style: 842 and 846 may have originally been built in the Italianate Style but were updated in the 1880s or 1890s to Second Empire, as was common in New Haven at this time. So, while all three properties now have mansard roofs, the entryways of 846 and 850 still have Italianate porticos peeking though their French shell.

842 and 850 both have store front additions that extend from the house towards the street. These additions first appear on the 1924 Sanborn Map but may have been built earlier. The store front on 850 extends to meet its neighbors, forming a continuous line of store frontage that begins at Clark Street. This triad of buildings contributes to the commercial downstairs, residential on top mixed use programming that dominates this section of State Street.

Before this purchase, the Waterproof Sole Company and East Rock Axel Works Company had each used 881 State as their home base for 3 and 12 years, respectively. 

Yet despite this past use, the Hygienic Ice Company would make a much more significant mark on the space during its 59-year stay. Although a factory already existed, the Hygienic Ice Company decided in 1924 to tear down the old scaled brick structure, which had been built in stages between 1867 and 1888, and create a very similar one in its place for $50,000. The two-story building, labelled 881 State Street, was to stand 144’ in height and would vary between 39.75’ and 74’ in depth. (The final measurements, however, would include a 160’x76’ north wing and a 100’x76’ south wing.)

Four years later, the company decided to add a scale house right at the intersection of State and Humphrey. For $1000 (plus a $3 fee), the one-story brick building would have a shed-style, genasco-covered roof. The original building permit states that the building would measure at a mere 18’ by 14’, but it eventually grew to 40’ by 50’. With these new facilities, the Hygienic Ice Company was soon able to produce 125 tons of ice each day during the winter and during  summer months that figure skyrocketed to 325 tons per day. In 1951, the Hygienic Ice Company shrank, and decided to share the factory space with the International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 478. The next year Hygienic Ice Co. left the space entirely, and the union relocated to the scale house, which became 889 State St. The organization remained there for 8 years, and following a three-year vacancy, the scale house became the home for Seavon Dental Lab, Inc. from 1965 until 1889. The space would remain empty again until 1997, when Dunkin Donuts, the present owner, purchased the property at 889 State, which remains a Dunkin Donuts as of 2015.

Unlike the scale house, the larger factory was unable to adapt to new owners with the same speed and efficiency. According to city directories, the first mention of occupancy after 1952 does not appear until 1991, when the Adult Probation Department relocated to a part of this building under the address 867 State Street. The other part of the building, 871 State, has seen a wide range of organizations in last the last 15 years. In 1993, the Center for Employee Assistance moved to the building, and somehow the space also served as the residence of Joann Donegan. A year later the Alcoholic Services Organization moved inside.. Six years later, Cornerstone, Inc. joined the slew of offices in the building. From 2009 to 2015, 871 State has served as the home of the New Haven Regional Children\'s Probate Court.

The first documentation of this location described two major mansions, the E.T. Fitch Mansion (81 Broadway) and Henry Rogers House (75 Broadway) (Figure 1).  These were standard models with living and entertaining on the ground floor and three bedrooms on the upper floor.  The adjacent lot down Broadway was empty and at 61/63 Broadway there were wood-framed buildings that came right up to the lot line.  The 1901 Sanborn map shows a dramatic change on these lots, extending the street frontage up Broadway with a new set of buildings from 65-81 Broadway, culminating in the Boardman Manual Training School at the corner of York Square Place and Broadway (Figure 2).  By 1911 the Hillhouse High School was built behind, changing the grain and signaling a larger intervention to come (Figure 3).  The directories from 1913 show the range of businesses from a druggist to dry goods.  Over the next two decades these programs stay consistent, though changing names and owners.  The 1933 directory indicates the Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company to the Connecticut Automatic Cigarette Vending Machine Company, and by 1953 it consisted of Gordon Hardware and Hatry &amp; Young Radios.

After acquisition by Yale University, the 1962 construction of Morse and Stiles colleges by Eero Saarinen imbued the area with a new feel.  Along Broadway, Saarinen placed the Stiles College masters house at the corner of York Street / Tower Parkway and designed the end piece to the chain of Broadway stores.  This six bay structure consisted of the same rubble concrete as the colleges and provided a small tunnel-like passage on the acquired property connecting to the central passageway between the colleges and to the gym.  In the original design, this block was completely facing Broadway with large entrances at each end of the building, recessed under concrete canopies.  This was originally filled by Yale Co-op, a longstanding bookstore founded by a group of instructors and students in 1885 (1).

The low storefronts at 63-69 Broadway consisted of a series of small shops and in 1974 was bought by the Yale Co-op to be an eastern extension and renovated with a postmodern front by Herbert Newman Architects.  According to the Historical Building report it was “intended to harmonize with earlier co-op building at 77 Broadway as well as Morse and Stiles Colleges behind.”  It rises to correspond with roofline of the earlier building more abstract in its application, highly planar with offset entry cuts supplemented by illusionistic painting (2).

The story of the Yale Co-op’s transition to Barnes and Noble in 1999 was a controversial affair.  Their supposed complacency in service, disorganization, unwilling to stay open for later hours implicated their move to Chapel Street across from the green, eventually going out of business in 2002.  Barnes in Noble on the other hand renovated the set of buildings, reconstructed the passageway and rearranged the entrances, connecting the buildings underground.  They also added the restaurant on the backside of the buildings.  There are rumors in the current local papers of new discussions; the Yale Bookstore is looking for a new makeover and that among other changes, the side of the store that houses Yale merchandise will get a new tenant (3).

In 1926, the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that the construction of apartments exceeded that of single-family dwellings in 265 cities in the United States. In New Haven alone, 200 apartment buildings that together contained 2,560 housing units were built between 1870 and 1930. This was mostly a response to a population boom in New Haven during this period; there was an influx of immigrants, birthrates rose and in particular, during WWI, the city attracted munitions and mechanic workers to work in factories. In addition, the percentage of renters within the city’s population increased, opening up the market for affordable rental units in apartment buildings. However, of the 200 apartment buildings built in New Haven, only twenty are located in the more working class neighborhoods of New Haven such as City Point, East Long Wharf, Fair Haven, Wooster, and the Hill, where the Elaine Apartments are located.

These apartments were built as personal businesses. Louis Miller owned the Elaine Apartments, but was also the carpenter and mason for the project. It is interesting to note that 87.16% of owners of apartments built in New Haven from 1870 to 1929 were also the carpenters or masons for the project. Generally, these owners started out as carpenters or masons and once they acquired enough wealth, they would build an apartment building as their own business. Most of these apartments were named after the owner, so who was Elaine? Perhaps she was Louisʼs wife or daughter.','','[]','[]','[]','[]','','','A 1920s courtyard apartment dwelling, a common New Haven building type from a time when the city was expanding.

The building’s architect, Jacob Weinstein, was a well-known architect for apartment buildings. He designed around thirty in New Haven, including this complex in the Hill neighborhood. The building has no elevator unlike other more luxurious apartments built at the time, which shows that this apartment was built for a more working class clientele. However, the apartment building was designed to distinguish itself from the low class tenements that were popular in the industrial age. The building is topped with crenellations and has a small, elevated courtyard at the entrance making it seem much grander than it is. The building is brick because new fire codes had been added in the late 19th / early 20th century, shortly before the building’s construction.

Looking at the Sanborn map of 1886, it is evident that the block was mostly residential except for an engine house across the street and a police station two blocks down. The lot adjacent to the one that would house the Elaine Apartments from 1925 onwards was occupied by a “Wagon House” that might have painted wagons and designed liveries for them, for it is labeled as a “livery” on the map. Only one house set back from the street was in the lot of what would become the Elaine Apartments. In 1901, the block was still mostly residential and the same house was still in the lot of the Elaine Apartments. However, the wagon house had expanded and now acted as carriage sheds and a livery. In 1911, the owner of the house on 703 Howard Ave was Estella J. Parmeiee, and not much had changed in the area. In 1924, an addition was appended to the house. Furthermore, the carriage shed in the lot next to it changed into a series of several buildings, one still acting as a shed, and a plumbing factory was added at the end of the block. These were the conditions the year before the Elaine Apartments were built.','[\'Preservation & Renewal towards Trowbridge Square\']','[]','[]','None');

The new building, constructed in 1965 and still standing today, is modern in style and was designed by the Connecticut-based architecture firm Simeone &amp; Wendler.  At seven stories high, the building was constructed with 36 apartment units.  Of particular note on the building’s façade is the emphasis on these individual units, each identical but separated from each other by regularly spaced concrete posts.  This concrete frame serves both a functional and a minimalist aesthetic purpose, with the tiles between the concrete posts affording little additional decoration.  Though the building’s ground level was enclosed during a 2005 renovation, this space was originally open to the street and served as a car parking facility—an effort to ensure that this apartment building would be compatible with the modern automobile-oriented urban environment.  Before the enclosure of the ground level, the building itself seemed to be raised on concrete stilts, as if to separate the residential space from the messiness of the street.  During the 2005 renovation, the building’s surface also acquired its distinctive yellow color; in the original design, the building’s brown and gray tones allowed the structure to blend unobtrusively with the natural tones of the surrounding buildings.

By the early 1970s, the building’s vacancy rates were high, at 20 percent by the end of 1971, as were rent delinquency rates.  In March 1971, the Peter James Corporation sold the apartment building to The Center Corporation.  This change in ownership did not directly affect the building’s tenants.  However, in November of the same year, The Center Corporation sold the building to Rex Realty by way of the Branford Development Company.  At this point, Rex Realty closed the building in order to renovate the apartments and rid the space of its so-called “undesirable” occupants, including drug traffickers and prostitutes. Rex Realty, a real estate investment company now known as M. F. DiScala Company, saw the apartment building as a potential “value-added” investment, recognizing that the building had been well constructed but required significant renovations and upgrades.  Originally known as the “Peter James Apartments,” the building was renamed with the magisterial title “The Regency.”  In recent decades, the apartments have remained under the ownership of M. F. DiScala Company and have managed to sustain occupancy rates around 95 percent.  The apartments now cater primarily to Yale University graduate students.','[]','','1965','[]','[]','Simeone & Wendler','','297 George Street, New Haven, CT 06510','41.3055338','','[\'Preservation & Renewal towards Trowbridge Square\']','None');

According to the New Haven City Directories of this period, LeBrun was the proprietor of the Sterling Shoe Company, which was located in this building." According to the 1910 New Haven City Directory,  Edward F. Smith\'s Brass, Wrought Iron, and Wire company resided next door to LeBrun\'s Sterling Shoe Company. Three years later, the 1913 New Haven City Directory would show that Smith\'s company had been replaced by the Keystone Press. Following World War II, the State Street Redevelopment and Renewal Plan would completely transform this area of lower State Street through a combination of redevelopment and rehabilitation in an attempt to strengthen the Central Business District and revitalize what had become obsolete or blighted. This plan would also ultimately see the the last known companies to have been established in this building, the New Haven Leather Co. and T.J. McDermott, two companies that were around until 1999.

In the earliest recorded transaction of the site, the Bishops bought the property from the Baldwins in 1850 and passed ownership between members of the family through bequests by way of death of the patriarch/matriarch to the next of kin. According to New Haven directories from 1860s - 1900, Timothy H. Bishop, son of the first Bishop to live on the estate, was a physician and ran a practice out of his home. The Bishop\'s downtown neighborhood was mostly residential during their ownership, with Eli Whitney\'s estate just around the corner on Elm Street. However, even as early as 1911, the Security Insurance Company had been established on the corner of Church and Elm, beginning the shift in downtown development towards civic and financial services.

New Haven grew rapidly in population over the Bishops\' ownership and Church St. became less a place for family residences than for commercial enterprises. According to the census, New Haven\'s population was 40,00 in 1863, 50,840 in 1870 and 108,027 by 1900. Numerous banks and financial institutions were established in the city to meet this new demand and many were located on Church and nearby Court Street. After Jane Maria Bishop\'s death (2/1/1924), the family sold the building to Edward M. Bradley &amp; Company Investments who demolished the house and built the current building to serve their commercial needs. Bradley acquired a couple of adjacent plots of land within his first five years of ownership, then settled in to a quarter-century long tenure in the building which ended for unknown reasons in 1959. Bradley rented portions of the building to other tenants, most notably the Connecticut Forest and Park Assn.

Since 1959 the building has been occupied by three different banks: First New Haven National Bank, Connecticut National Bank and The Bank of Southern Connecticut, in that order. A 1973 sanborn map shows that by that year, the neighborhood had become almost entirely commercial offices and  commerce-related businesses. Neither the president of The Bank of Southern Connecticut, nor the compliance and technology officer (security guard) know much about the history of the building, other than the fact that the original Otis elevator still functions and the original vault door remains, not operational, but as a point of interest (both pictured below).

The Bishop estate consisted of two structures, with a small separate building behind the main residence\'s extension towards the back of the lot. Also, the two-story Bishop house had a pitched roof that reached over the edge of the building, a symmetrical smooth stone facade with centered entrance sandwiched between pillars and below a protruding bay window, as well as a small, waist-high fence around the edge of their property on Church, indicating private residential property.

Two-story, red brick and white detailing around the entryway, fenestration, and parapet.  Arched windows frame the banking level, with protruding clock.  A simple portico entrance is flourished with a broken pediment.  In 2017 appears to be seeking tenant.   ','[]','This style, hosting a bank\'s civic/commercial program, stands in contrast to the neo-classical style used for other important city buildings, including the courthouse directly across Church, and several other banks and municipal buildings downtown. It is interesting to consider this relatively squat building in the context of the loftier high-rises in the current downtown district and in the late 1920s development era, when art deco skyscrapers in nearby cities, like New York, were pushing vertical limits in a sleek modern style. 215 Church\'s colonial revival style is more backward-looking, referencing New Haven\'s conservative religious roots, and is within an architectural tradition that is especially particular to New Haven - a colonial revival and federal tradition that Cass Gilbert honored in his design of New Haven Public Library, and is rooted in a few early federal-era buildings, like United Church on the Green. Another hypothesis for the relative stoutness of the building is that with the development of the twelve-story Union and New Haven Trust building, completed in the same year and in the same architectural style, it could have been anticipated that additional office space would not be in demand. A final explanation may be that the original owner of the 1927 building, Edward Bradley, as just one person and not a corporation, didn\'t have the capital to undertake such a large project.

The Historic Resources Inventory gives a thorough, though technical, description of the current building\'s physical details: "2-story masonry commercial building, 5 bays wide and 5 bays deep. Building has a flat roof with cut-stone parapet (has alternating panels with blind balusters and solid panels). Below the parapet is a modilion cornice. The fenestration is symmetrical with rectilinear bays on the 2nd floor and arched bays on the first. The upper story windows have a simple reveal, 6x6 sash, flat-arch window head with keystone, and small sill. The ground floor windows have thick transom and muntin bars separating paired 2x2 sash with fanlight tracery overhead. The arch has narrow archivolt with keystone at its apex. The entry is off-center, in the extreme left side of the facade and features an elaborate surround with narrow pilasters supporting an entablature with broken pediment. The entry has a deep reveal with paneled surface".

The current building was built in 1910 by the Seamless Rubber Company to house their facilities. According to historical maps of New Haven, photographs of which are provided below, no building existed on the site until Seamless Rubber bought the property and built a factory there. The Seamless Rubber Company was founded in 1876 and later moved to a 375,000 square foot factory on Hallock Avenue, one block over from Daggett Street. Seamless Rubber began by producing nipples for baby’s bottles and was later immensely involved in production of various items used extensively by the armed forces during World War II. During its prime, the Seamless Rubber Company was so successful that a 1948 brochure produced by the New Haven Chamber of Commerce hailed the company as “one of the economic cornerstones of New Haven.”1 An interesting quote from the pamphlet describes the extent of the company’s production:

It can truly be said that Seamless follows each and every individual from the cradle to the grave. A baby is delivered with hands encased in Seamless surgical gloves, its first bottle feeding is from a Seamless nipple, its first tummy ache is easy by a Seamless hot water bottle, and as that baby grows to maturity, it will use at some time or other athletic equipment of the Seamless all-rubber molded type, Seamless “Stick-Bands” for cuts and bruises, a Seamless ice bag for an aching head and dozens of other Seamless products...Having been delivered by an obstetrician wearing Seamless Rubber gloves, it is quite possible that this same individual will be embalmed by a mortician wearing a Seamless autopsy glove.2

According to a permit in the New Haven Building Records Office, by 1967, the factory building was owned by a Mr. Joseph Waronka. Another building permit from 1973 indicates that Waronka removed makeshift partitions in the building in order to rent certain areas to tenants as loft spaces. In 1986, the building was sold to Daggett Street Square Incorporated who continued the trend of using the building for loft living. Finally, in 2004, the building was sold to 69-75 Daggett Street, LLC who currently owns the building and continues to rent the building to tenants as loft spaces and for factory production of assorted goods.

One incredibly interesting note about 69-75 Daggett Street is that although it is mainly used for loft style living, the majority of the tenants are artists who use their rented lofts as studio space as well. Fortunately for me, I was able to visit several of the lofts/studios as part of New Haven’s Open Studio events. This allowed me to tour the inside of the building and to take pictures of the building’s interior. Because of the building’s factory construction, the result of which is a very open interior, its architectural transition into an apartment building seems almost seamless. The hallways are navigable and the building, to a very large extent, retains facets of its days as a factory including old factory doors and windows which are documented in the pictures below.

The New Haven Shoe Company, a fairly well-established boot and shoe dealer, became the building\'s first tenant. In 1911, the company moved from two blocks down Chapel into the new building, starting a long trend of nearby businesses moving into 950 Chapel as an upgrade. In its early years, the building was divided into two storefronts and an entrance to a stair up to the second floor. The second storefront was used by H. M. Hodges and Brother, a retailer of paint, wallpaper, picture frames, and greeting cards, while the upstairs was used in some capacity as an office for Morris Steinert and Sons piano-sellers, the building\'s owners. A wealthy Bavarian immigrant who co-founded the New Haven Symphony Orchestra, Steinert had his main headquarters elsewhere on Chapel, but after he died in 1912, his company likely used the upstairs of 950 Chapel as auxiliary office space. While the reverse-lookup section of the city directories never list Steinert\'s company as an occupant at 950 Chapel, Steinert\'s company owned the building from its construction until the mid-1960s.[3]
In 1926, the Shoe Company and H. M. Hodges were replaced by a new business which would use the space for the next four decades. Even before it moved into 950 Chapel, the House of Hasselbach sweet shop was well known in New Haven for its fresh chocolates and ice creams and its elaborate decor. 

"Shops that enjoy the distinction of universal popularity vary in different communities," __ wrote in the Saturday Chronicle, the high-society newspaper. "...You ask any woman or man if New Haven has any shop like the ones that are being referred to, and the answer you will invariably get is \'Why, Hasselbach\'s is like that.\'"[4] 

Owned by William F. Hasselbach, the shop catered to both "dignified matrons" and "schoolgirls in bevies," becoming a staple of the community.[5] Indeed, one guidebook described the House of Hasselbach as "one of the finest, as well as one of the most prosperous," eateries in the city.[6] Hasselbach\'s moved in during the boom times of the late \'20s, but by the time the Great Depression hit, the shop was forced to sublease the second storefront to the Style Millinery Shoppe (later the Style Frock Shop). The Steinert offices remained on the second floor.[7]
The building again saw major changes in the next few decades. In 1941, Hasselbach\'s lost a case at the Connecticut Supreme Court, which ruled that sublet payments are taxable income. Two years later, the shop was purchased by Daniel Lewis Harrison, an entrepreneur and co-founder of the Culinary Institute of America. Over the next twenty years, Harrison opened chain locations of Hasselbach\'s across Connecticut and Massachusetts. The building\'s newfound prosperity, however, ended in the mid-1960s. In 1964, the House of Hasselbach closed, leaving behind Adler\'s Card \'N\' Party Shop in the other storefront until it, too, closed in 1970. The deed to the property was sold and resold many times in this period. The building fell completely vacant for a few years, emblematic of the neighborhood as a whole. In fact, in 1971, not only was 950 Chapel Street empty, but so too were twenty-eight of the twenty-nine units in the Lincoln Building next door. The next year, National Savings Bank moved into the building, and only gradually thereafter were the nearby vacancies filled.[8]','New Haven Shoe Company, H. M. Hodges and Brother, and Morris Steinert (owner)','[\'Institutional\']','[\'Load-bearing masonry\']','[]','[\'Yes, business hours\']','By the 1980s, the building had begun to assume its current form. In February 1983, National Savings Bank merged into People\'s Bank, which put its name on the building but otherwise changed little, other than adding a sign perpendicularly attached between the first and second story. By 1997, the bank had moved elsewhere, and the First Church of Christ, Scientist, located in the neighborhood since at least the 1930s, moved in the next year. The interior was again renovated, this time by local architect Francis Albis of Albis Turlington: the church added a chapel, reading room, and study spaces while the façade lost its large lettering up top, replaced by smaller, gold letters above the door. An emergency exit was added on the first floor on the left side, the final façade alteration to the building. Today, the top floor is rented out as office space for the Trinity Church on the Green.[10]
As the neighborhood transitioned from a civic and religious precinct to a bustling shopping district to a financial center, 950 Chapel tracked these changes in its form and use. Through so many changes, the building has yet again become a church, but not without the legacy of its intervening occupants having shaped the physical space and surrounding neighborhood.','2','Through its many lives, owners, and uses, 950 Chapel Street has, perhaps fittingly, returned to its original function as a house of worship. Overlooking the Green with its high-storied, "stripped classical" façade, 950 Chapel Street now is home to New Haven\'s congregation of the First Church of Christ, Scientist. Likewise, the building was originally constructed on the site of the Center Church Chapel, an annex of the Center Church on the Green.[1] In between, the building\'s form and use changed many times, reflecting the changing currents and needs of the neighborhood.
','[\'Rolled Composition\']','From its construction until sometime before the mid-1950s, the building\'s façade featured two storefronts on the bottom and high windows above, all boxed in by a three-sided ornamental frame and topped by a cornice. The cornice and sides were highly decorated with many geometric, boxy designs. By the mid-1950s, however, the façade was refaced and most of the designs were removed to create a flat, "stripped classical" look. The upper story windows were divided into two bays by a central, round pillar in the middle and two like pilasters on either side, strikingly different in style from the rest of the flat, rectilinear façade. Finally, in 1971, when the bank moved in and remodeled the interior, the façade assumed its current form. Under architect Andrew F. Euston, the main door was accentuated with thick jambs and lintel; the upper story was divided into three bays without pillars; the green, ridged, metal sections between the stories were added; and the bank\'s name was added in embossed letters above the second story. Throughout all three designs, through, the three-sided, protruding frame of the original construction was maintained, and the overall shape and size of the building behind the façade did not change.[9]','1911','[\'Chapel Street\', \'Downtown\', \'Town Green\']','[\'Brick\', \'Concrete\', \'Plaster\']','Most recent renovation (1998) done by Francis Albis of Albis Turlington','New Haven Shoe Company, William F.

Within, lay a large lecture room for prayer meetings and a dedicated space for Sunday school. By 1910, however, storefronts had been built immediately abutting it as the Chapel Street streetscape filled in and commercialized. Thus in 1910-11, the chapel was demolished and replaced by a store building, largely the same structure that stands today. Long and narrow, the building hosted two storefronts on the first floor, with a dumbbell-shaped second floor to let in air above. As part of a larger wave of development, the building soon sat between the Lincoln Building, then headquarters of the Knights of Columbus, which bordered it to the west and the stores of the 934-942 Chapel Street building adjoined to it on the east.[2]','[\'Touring Chapel, Crown & High\']','[\'Institutional\', \'Retail\']','[]','[1] Arnold Guyot Dana, New Haven, Old and New: Its Homes, Institutions, Activities, etc., Disclosing Changes that Present Problems, unpublished scrapbook, part 2, 37, 47, New Haven Museum; Sanborn Map and Publishing Company, Insurance Maps of New Haven, Connecticut, map series, (New York: Sanborn, 1886, 1901, 1911, 1924, 1930, 1960, and 1973), http://www.library.yale.edu/MapColl/print_sanborn.html; and Price and Lee Company, [Greater] New Haven [City] Directory, book series (New Haven: Price and Lee, 1908-1998).

New Haven Paper Co. was in the 15 Orange building and the 21 Orange Street building was a warehouse.  Warehouse space was added to the back of the first floor of 15 Orange in the early 20s that connected the two buildings.  The back warehouse was used by the New Haven Paper Company, who was there until 1926.  After this, it was succeeded by two other paper companies, Arnold Roberts Paper Co and Rouke Eno Paper Co.  The paper business left the site in 1934 at which point it was vacant for two years during the Great Depression.

In 1936, the Nemrow Brothers Inc. wholesale grocers moved into the 15 Orange Street property.  They were there until 1968, after which it became American News Co Grocers. This store was then replaced by a convenient store, Crown Tabaco and Candy, which was there until 1986. Next door, in 21 Orange, was Norge Grill. It opened in 1965 after renovations to make the space suitable for a restaurant.  Norge Grill was a community staple for many years.  It was vacant from 1987 through 1989 during construction.

In 1987 the alley between 15 and 21 Orange was filled in with a central entrance and stairway connecting all four floors.  Sapienza & Lessig, located in West Haven, CT, designed the addition.  South Orange Street Associates, who owned the building and had an office there, commissioned the renovation.  Along with filling in the alley to unite the two structures, windows were added into the sides of the building to allow more light into the apartments and an elevator was put in along with the stairs.  After this, 15 Orange became one single address.  The new addition gave the 15 apartments on the top three floors a separate entrance at the front and back of the building.  Heidi’s Uniform shop moved into the right side of the building and the left was a photography store.

Miso Restaurant did its own renovations to the site in 2002 when it moved in. The Japanese restaurant added a patio and eventually a partial covering designed by the architect Dean Sakamoto.  They also did a lot of aesthetic changes to the front and inside of the restaurant.   Jmart opened in 2005, replacing Graffio Jewelers.  There are still 15 apartments on the top three floors.

It was a two story building with a school on the first floor and Hiram’s Lodge, on the second.  The building was highly recognizable because of the cupola structure on the top.  In 1841, Elihu and John Myers were grocers on the 15 Orange site, which starts a 150 year pattern of food stores on this land.

The buildings were built by the Washington architecture firm Chloethiel, Woodward, Smith in 1965 as part of New Haven’s Oak Street Area Redevelopment Project.  This project, the product of five years of research and planning, was begun in the late 50s as the first installment of Mayor Richard C. Lee’s large urban renewal plan for New Haven.  The land and existing structures in the Oak Street Area were purchased by the city, which secured the necessary property through eminent domain, and sold to private developers (such as the Boston-based Presidential Realty Corporatio, owner of Crown Court/Crown Towers).  Several families were relocated to make way for the massive demolition and reconstruction of the area.

According to the New Haven Redevelopment Agency (a group formed with the advent of this late 50s and 60s urban renewal push), the goals of the project included “help[ing] its residents clear out ugly blight and slums, provide decent housing and better health, [and] build better streets and schools…help[ing] its business community provide expansion space, provide adequate off-street parking, eliminate traffic bottlenecks, [and] reverse the flow of shoppers and shops to the outskirts”.  For traffic purposes the Oak Street Area Project modified street layout and traffic right-of-way and built the Oak Street Connector.  It also aimed, through the construction of surrounding middle-income residential buildings, to create a boundary for the business section of town so that businesses would be concentrated in the one central area and not dispersed along several streets (the planners wanted separate- and not mixed-use buildings).  Crown Court/Crown Towers was one such residential building complex, located in block B of the plan (see maps).  Though a few spaces in the buildings are used as professional doctor’s and dentist’s offices and at one point there was a proposal for a ground-level coffee shop in the works, 123 and 129 York Street mostly consist of apartments.  Today they do signal the end of the row of street businesses; in that vicinity one is in almost purely residential territory.

Materials of interest that I have included are: maps of the existing zoning and traffic patterns before the Oak Street Area redevelopment; maps of the proposed (and executed) zoning and traffic patterns under the Oak Street Area plan; the current-day Assessor’s report with a small photograph of the buildings; and a photocopy of a 1955 booklet printed by the New Haven Register of articles and images pertaining to the Oak Street Area Redevelopment Project., with such titles and headlines as “City Agencies Tag Oak St. Section as Sub-Standard”, “Camera Shows Some of Existing Conditions in Oak St.”, “Cost Estimated at $17 million; Private Capital Would Invest $14 million”, “Major Street Pattern Changes Scheduled”, and “Bettering the City’s Economic Health”.','[]','','1965','[\'Connector\', \'Crown Street\']','[]','Chloethiel, Woodward, and Smith','','129-123 York Street, New Haven, CT','41.2767867','','[\'Historic Chapel West and Dwight Edgewood\']','None');

The corner plot upon which is sits was owned by the prestigious Atwater family. The Atwaters were one of the great entrepreneurs and developers of nineteenth century Connecticut. There was even a portion of the city known as the “Atwater Block” which contained a segment of Grand Ave that runs parallel to St John St. The block was full of various businesses including Atwater’s stationary and common goods shop. This particular location, however, served as a private residence for members of the Atwater family. Jeremiah Atwater built the Atwater House at what was then 25 College Street, currently 218-224 College St. The rest of their property, including the future location of 245 Crown Street was utilized as a private garden area. Atwater’s choice to develop this property led to eastern expansion of Crown Street, the greatest expansion seen since 1775.

Blakeslee was a name not quite as old as Atwater but equally as prestigious by the time they bought the Atwater House and the land it sat on in 1911. C.W. Blakeslees &amp; Sons was founded in 1844. The family itself had swept through New Haven County even earlier, bringing with them a slew of new pioneers. The business was primarily concerned with construction. They possessed numerous quarries in the area and are responsible for a number of the early docks built in New Have during the early twentieth century. Descendent s of this clan carry on the legacy through two major Connecticut business: Blakeslees Prestress, Inc. and Blakeslee Arpaia Chapman, Inc. Naturally, C.W. Blakeslees &amp; Sons also dealt in real estate as well.

The Atwater House was immediately put to commercial use. Keeping with the changing trend of the block from residential to business, they separated the main unit into three distinct segments. Two stores bordering an internal auto lot.  Blakeslee also extended the two stores, attaching two wood frame fixtures at the front of the building, facing College St. In 1915, Blakeslee constructed two adjacent brick buildings of a similar design to what had been the Atwater House, 245 and 247 Crown Street. These one story structures were then leant to commercial use.  They rented out the space to two tenants: Chong Lee Laundry and Kassin M H Tailor.

These two businesses proved to be incredibly resilient throughout the years. Kassin M H Tailor remained in 247 Crown well into the 1970s. Chong Lee Laundry underwent a name change in 1950 when it became Wugin Lee Laundry. Whether the laundry gained new tenants or merely altered its title remains unknown. What is known however is that the Chong Lee Laundry was a common name in New Haven during this time. There existed several other Chong Lee Laundries within a five block radius of the one located at 245 Crown Street including a location southeast on College Street.  The laundry changed names again in 1965 to Quong Yu Laundry. The success of these two businesses may have been due in part to their incredibly convenient locations. In the early 1920s when they were still being established, a wave of construction hit the area surrounding these two buildings with auto lots and gas stations. By the 1950s the few dwellings that still existed in the surrounding area had been sacrificed to make way for the motor age.

In the 1970s the laundry finally disappeared to be replaced by the Paramount Barber Shop. This tonsorium lasted about a decade until 1981 when both 245 and 247 Crown Street are listed as vacant. These two units remain unoccupied for a decade. It was verified that C.W. Blakeslee and Co. owned the lot where 245/247 Crown Street sat well into the 1950s. No clear record of them selling the property exists until it is bought in 1990. The reason for the buildings’ disuse can be inferred by knowledge of the general state of New Haven, particularly Crown Street in the 1980s. An economic downturn hit the area in the 1980s resulting in transient tenants and a rising number of bankrupt and abandoned businesses. It is also during this time that Blakeslee was selling off large portions of its property to different real estate organization as it moved towards a focus on construction alone.

When the building was revived in 1990 many changes had occurred. The most striking was its transformation from two units to one. Directory listings for both 245 and 247 exist until 1984. When the property was bought by the China Hut Restaurant the address was listed simply as 245 Crown Street. It can be inferred that during this time the façade, which now currently exists on the street side of the building was added since there is no record of its construction post-1990.

The China Hut Restaurant and its predecessor, another restaurant called El Nino, enjoyed short stints in the location before the Istanbul Café was established in 1998. The head chef, Adnan Efé bought the restaurant in 2001 and has owned it ever since. The Istanbul Café boasts a position as the only Turkish restaurant in New Haven. The restaurant offers its customers an authentic feel and menu. One feels as if they were transported into another world when they enter the café. Still benefiting from its placement next to several public autolots and among the bustle of New Haven activity, 245 Crown Street enjoys a diverse customer group of students, locals, and professionals, taken in by the exotic appeal, and uniqueness of the Instanbul Café.

The lot on which the bakery lies is one acre in size and borders the two streets mentioned, as well as Gilbert Street to the north. In addition to the one story brick structure that houses the bakery and its storefront, the lot also includes a stand-alone wooden structure that serves as a small warehouse and storage space for the company.[1] There are private spaces for parking, and at the back of the building, there are 8 sets of double doors in front of which the company’s delivery vans park. Except where the storefront meets the sidewalk on Cedar and Washington, the lot is completely fenced in. The lots to the west down Washington and across the street are Yale-owned parking lots (most likely used for the medical school community); the bordering buildings on Cedar and Gilbert are also owned by Yale as part of the medical school community. The surrounding area is a mixture of influences: the large, multi-story Yale medical buildings and parking garages grouped on one side of the bakery, and the somewhat older, more residential multi-family homes, storefronts and community centers to the south and west.

The physical structure that houses Lupi’s bakery is a one story brick masonry structure with a corner storefront with entrances from both Cedar Street and Washington Avenue. The storefront windows only extend a portion of the way up the building, and otherwise, there are virtually no windows, besides three long, skinny slat windows with metal screen coverings facing Washington Ave. The retail store takes up a small fraction of the interior of the building, which has high ceilings and is constructed largely of stone.  A majority of the building is used for housing the large baking machinery and for carrying out the operations of the bakery on a wholesale level. In fact, much of the baking equipment in Lupi’s is original machinery brought over from the company’s previous location on Dixwell Avenue in Hamden, CT, where they operated for over 75 years previous to their move to Washington Avenue in 1983.[2]

Due to the influence of industry over the years, as well as the development of the Yale medical community, the area around Washington Avenue has changed a good deal over the course of the 20th century. Though some older structures do remain, what is currently Lupi’s bakery is actually a fairly new building. Fred Sgro, who owned the Marchigiano/Boston Model Bakery a few lots down Washington Avenue (this baking company shows up as early as 1937 in the City Directory, under various owners previous to Sgro, who takes ownership around 1951)[3] applied to City Hall for a permit to erect a one-story masonry structure to serve as a bakery in November 1977.[4] Under agent Richard Ramadi, contractor Roger Ricard and a New Britain, CT-based private engineering firm A.N. Vendola &amp; Associates, the building was completed and approved as a bakery in December 1979 at a $150,000 cost.[5] In 1983, William Lupi bought out Boston Model Bakery, taking over the current brick structure and changing it to Lupi’s Bakery. As mentioned, Lupi’s Bakery had a long history in Connecticut, and today they sell to well-known local establishments like Yale’s Durfee’s store and Mory’s Association.[6]

Contextual Note: The area surrounding the Washington Ave and Cedar Street corner was, throughout time, a generally low-scale commercial area, with a variety of stores, smaller manufacturing plants, and some residential amenities, including a schoolhouse on Cedar and Gilbert that shows up on Sanborn maps from 1886 until 1924.[7] The current site of Lupi’s bakery went through many address changes, and for most of the 20th century until the late 1970s was listed as 151 Washington Avenue.[8] Starting in 1913 (first documented City Directory), this property was owned by Albert Quinto, whose family owned several properties, both commercial and residential, in the nearby area. From the 1910s-1970s, this corner lot housed a confectionary, a variety store, and various groceries, and at times it was vacant. It was not until 1977 or 1978 that the corner lot on Washington and Cedar became 169 Washington, coinciding with the construction of the current brick structure (Lupi’s) on that site[9]. Many of the lots nearby were paved over by the New Haven Redevelopment Agency in these years[10] and made into parking lots or turned over to Yale for the medical school, which dominates a great deal of the built environment in the area today.

The entire building consists of four separate units connected to each other, each with a separate entrance designated by a sandstone stoop, hooded entry, and delicate iron rails. The exterior of the building is white, with a slate mansard roof. The mansard roof is accented by a molded curb-line and cast-iron cresting, and a center pavilion that gives the roof (that spans the full width of the building) a focal point. The ground floor has 8 bay windows spaced across the width of the building, one square bay on the left and right edge of the building respectively, and canted bays in between. According to a 1945 surveyor’s map, exterior walls are 12” brick, interior walls are 8” brick, and stone foundation walls are roughly 18”. The current assessed value of the 0.1 acre parcel is $673,260.

Built in the late 1800s, each of the four units in this building originally functioned as a single-family home. New Haven directory listings indicate that each unit was occupied by a single resident or a married couple. Residents appear to have been drawn from the industrial and working classes, including such professions as a New Haven Gas and Light Co. employee (1913), a dressmaker (1913), a nurse (1920), a molder (1935), and a factory inspector (1955). According to New Haven directories, some residents rented out extra rooms in their units, but by the 1950s they appear to have been formally divided into separate apartments, as multiple residents from different families appear under each address. By the late 1960s there were as many as seven separate residents listed for each address. In the early 1970s the property was purchased by Yale University and underwent a significant renovation and rehabilitation circa 1975. This included a standardization of the interiors, which today all have carpeting, vinyl tile flooring in the kitchens and bathrooms, and mini-blinds in the living room and bedroom windows. After this process was completed, the apartments were opened up as graduate student housing, and today there are 22 apartments: five efficiencies, sixteen one-bedrooms, and one two-bedroom unit. Residents enjoy basement storage and laundry, and a courtyard which facilitates small gatherings and social events.

It is on the edge of the 9th Square, which has largely been left in tact with buildings dating between1820–1950. In contrast, The Washington Building stands directly across  from what was the Chapel Square Mall redevelopment, one of New Haven’s greatest buildings during the time of large-scale urban renewal; it currently exists as the site for the new Gateway Community College, reflecting the mutability just outside the traditional border of the 9th Square. Typical buildings of the 9th Square have the following characteristics: 3 to 5 stories in height, little or no setback form the sidewalk, brick as the predominant building material (sometimes with brownstone and other finishes); additionally, many of the structures feature decorative treatments in terra cotta, have supported cornices, moldings above the windows, and other decorative treatments to the façades. The Washington  Building exemplifies this style. It has three stories as well as a mezzanine and basement. It is of brick construction with terracotta details on the façade. It has a flat roof with a beautiful and pronounced modillion cornice, with denticular molding. The top half story is punctuated by tri-part window groupings. Above the other, square, windows on the rest of the building, there are large panels with cartouche enrichments in dramatic relief. There is also a two story molded architrave. Its first floor forms a clear storefront, with large windows.

Offices: Historically, the building has functioned as it does now with a commercial store front on the first floor and offices above. The tenants of the offices have changed and varied greatly. Lawyers are the most constant group of office occupants, having been there since the beginning of the 20th century. More broadly, insurance and small business owners also have been the main occupants of the offices in the Washington Building.

Store Front: In 1901, the restaurant Hof Brau Haus (sometimes Hofbrau Haus) opened on the corner (what today is 130 Crown St). It was immensely popular, as is evident from both a 1939 news article is headed, “August Janssen, Famed Restauranteur Who Opened Hofbrau Here, Dies At 72” as well as from its continued existence into the early 1970s. This corner would soon turn into a bar and club holding. By 1986, there is record of a basement café/club. In 1999, this idea would grow grand in scale with the establishment of Gotham City Café, a popular nightclub. Today, it’s name has changed to Empire, loosing the “café” part of the name, which had historically been a sort of euphemism for saloons, since at least the late 19th century when the Washington Building replaced salooons refered to as cafés (see article in image 6: “It was late in the nineties that the term saloon was dropped and these drinking emporiums adopted the European style of referring to them as cafes”). Other original tenants include Frolich Cigar Store and Nathan Kaufman Mens Furnishings. The Washington building in 1946 still maintained the same type of retail as it originally did: there existed a Schulte Cigars, Florsheim Shoes, and Whitten’s Haberdasher. From the 1960s until the 1990s, Gilden’s Jewelers existed, but then was replaced by a nail salon, as it is now.

Further Narrative: The building numbering 35–39 Church St. in New Haven. maintains its appellation “The Washington Building”. Church Street has been a commercial strip long before the Washington Building’s construction. In 1849, there was a boot and shoe emporium at 35 Church St. and in 1856, a Chinese tea store at 33 1/2 Church St. The Washington Building replaced one of New Haven’s earliest hotels, the Central House—sometimes referred to as the Main’s Hotel. Refer to Image 6 for this change. The intersection of Crown and Church St. has been a main thoroughfare of downtown New Haven long before the Washington Building was constructed, as evidence by the density of buildings and transportation (horse and buggy, then streetcar, and finally automobiles) in the historical images attached.

Edward M. Clark sold the Washington Building in 1911 to Nicholas W. Hubinger. The Hubinger family formed the Hubinger Holding Company to manage the ownership of the building and the tenants. This ownership transferred to Woostock Realty Incorporated in 1953, and is now in the hands of 39 Church St. LLC

The Maylinger &amp; Hugo Sausage Company was then the first floor tenant of the building. 

The main tenant of 116-120 Crown has been the Hotel National, which opened its doors in 1912 and closed around 1983-1984. Judging from the surrounding buildings of 116 Crown, which included billiard clubs, saloons, restaurants, and nightclubs, one can conclude that the 100’s section of Crown Street was a place for men and their “vices”. This conclusion would lead one to believe that The Hotel National was a SRO (single room occupancy) hotel, housing single men working industrial jobs and manual labor. This section of Crown was most likely for men who were transient journeymen, searching for day-to-day work and seeking solace at night through various sorts of entertainment such as drinking and gambling.

Tenants who shared the space with the National Hotel vary from the Grenon Bros. Saloon (1915) to an electrical company (Goldforb and Schultz electrical contractors, 1925) to a typewriter company (The New England Typewriter and Stationary Co., 1980-1995). The variety of stores that have inhabited 116-120 Crown show the building’s flexibility in reacting to the environment and inhabitants around it.

From the National Hotel’s closure in the mid 1980’s to the early 2000’s, the block that 116 Crown Street is situated on went through difficult times judging from the amount of adjacent vacant lots and the vacancies within 116-120 itself listed in New Haven directories.  The only businesses that endured through these tough times were Jim’s Sandwich Shop (1980-1995) and The New England Typewriter and Stationary Company.

According to a YDN article circa 2001, between 1995 and 1998 a fire erupted at 116-120 Crown and badly damaged the building. The city of New Haven came to possess the building in 1998 due to a series of foreclosures. In 2001 The Anderson Wilcox Corporation, a development and restoration company based in Branford, CT, purchased and renovated the property in order to create lofts and a ground floor restaurant. The vision was a success. Today the top four floors consist of lofts (including a recently added fifth story penthouse) and the ground floor is home to the restaurant “116 Crown.”','','[]','[]','[\'Romanesque Revival\']','[]','According to real estate documents in the Yale Sterling Memorial Library archives the Eld family of New Haven owned the property until they sold it to Frank Maylinger in 1894.','','This elegant building now houses a bar and sandwich restaurant in the shop fronts and recently rehabbed apartments above.

From the directories

In 1913, 260 Crown Street was the residence of Currington Edward T and Munson Fred T. Aside from residences, plots 260-266 Crown St included the Beta Theta Phi Hall at Yale University (#264). In 1914 the first garage moved into the block at plot number 257. In 1916, a Mrs. Celia Pigeon retained the house but the adjacent plots 262-266 were occupied by The White Motor Co.

In 1921 when an electric company opened offices next door it may have encouraged the conversion of the house from traditional single family residential accommodation to student residences. A nurse by the name of Mary Bancroft let the house to students. It is possible that the extensions depicted in the Sanborn were part of preparing the house to be let for single room lodging. In 1923 however Mrs. Pigeon moved back into the house and continued to let it to lodgers. In 1925 while 260 Crown was listed in the New Haven directories as vacant, 261 Crown was listed as Lowndes H E Furnished rooms.

In the early 1930’s 260 Crown Street was the site of Auto Rental Co, a city garage. It was one of the earliest properties to acquire a telephone line. By 1935 John F Lawlor had moved his garage from 254 to 260 Crown. At this time there were 3 large garage spaces operational within the two blocks street front. By 1951 his business had expanded to include plots 260-266. Throughout the 1940’s and up to the mid-1950’s Lawlor successfully ran his auto parking and services garage at the site. Although the automobile section occupies a large portion of advertisements in the directories, no advertisements for garages at 260 Crown were found in the directories.

In 1956, the property was leased to the Hertz Corpoation for 10 years. In 1967 Joseph McLaughlin had bought the property. He continued to lease out offices to the Hertz Corporation but he moved his garage, Kirk’s Garage, to the site. In 1978 he also introduced a newsstand at the Garage, Crown News.

In the early 1980s the garages at 260 Crown Street changed ownership. In 1988 Professional Parking (Pro Parking) leased the property and remained in business at the site until 2009. In1995 Aladdin’s Restaurant opened which later renamed to Aladdin Crown Pizza. The owner of Aladdin’s Crown Pizza rented out the Garage and runs the business currently. The current owners of the properties at 254-266 are James and Joseph Salatto.

The New Haven directories count the number of residents and non-residents on the street in 3 years of print, 2001, 2003 and 2005. In this time the number of residents decreased from 116 to 67. This is however too short a period of time to draw any sufficient conclusions about recent trends.

Dana Archive 

From the Dana Archives the most relevant article to developments at 260 Crown Street is titled ‘The Transformation in 1915 of Crown and Neighboring College St – from newspaper of April 25, 1915’. It supports the charting of development from residential to logding and finally to garages stating that business such as assembly halls and lodges for fraternities, warehouses, small stores, apartments, stores (tailors and professional services) grew rapidly on the two streets.

The following statement from the article characterizes the process of transformation from residential to commercial zoning. ‘There are not now left many tenants of even the home of 20 years ago in College Street or in Crown Street. Reluctant as some of the owners have been to move business has swept into the streets at such a pace as to force people to give up their residences in those streets and move elsewhere’.

City Planning Department, Zoning Maps

The City Planning Department at City Hall has two zoning maps dated 1956 that classify the plot as Business B. The Block between York and High on Crown Street adjacent to the 260 Crown Street’s block is classified as Residence. The strip of buildings facing this block are classified as business set in a business  block. The revised map in 1958 shows the 260 Crown Street’s block to be surrounded by  Business zones. (Zoning Map, City of New Haven, Connecticut, Prepared by Bureau of Engineering, June 14, 1934)

Sanborn Maps 1886-1978

In 1886, the property, 260-266 Crown Street, is marked as two separate buildings at 260 and 266 Crown of. The materials are marked as masonry with small extensions constructed in wood. Occupation at either building is not listed.

In 1901 the building footprints did not change, however, the building at 266 Crown Street has a mezzanine level removed (2 ½ to 2) and is marked Stucco. The building at 260 Crown has ‘tin clad 3rd’ written on part of the building indicating a temporary roof. It is unclear if this extended to the entire 3rd floor or as far as the highlighted wooden extension.

In 1911, 266 has undergone a small renovation removing the wooden extension and is listed as used by Covington Trust Associates. 260 Crown is listed under the name Cornelia E. H Baldwin and has retained its wooden extension. The area appears to be primarily residential between1886 to 1911.

In 1924 both sides of the block have transformed radically catering to commercial activity. Plots 266 and 254 are both garages, enclosing plot 260 that has retained the house structure. Plot 266 is completely built up and has the capacity of 100 cars. It has connection for heating (via steam), light (electric) and a fright elevator. The house on 260 Crown reflects the changing character of the street by the addition of an extra floor (from 3 o 4 storey). Additions in the remaining block include a Hebrew Institute, another garage, Dorscht Hall and The Hutchinson Apartments. It is worth mentioning the amenity plot behind 26 Crown has transformed in this time from an Italian Baptist Church to a Jewish Synagogue. By 1973 the house on 260 Crown St was demolished and the Garage extended to have a second street front entrance.

Short Description / Narrative:  

260 Crown Street has responded to the process of urbanization in New Haven. It is easy to imagine what may have been a townhouse at 260 Crown in the late 1800’s was then converted to a multiple family house and ultimately, in response to a population influx, a rooming house in the 1920’s. The New Haven Historic Resources Inventory (reprinted in 2000) states, as the city ‘grew into a major industrial, transportation and educational center. Its population went from 40,000 in 1861 to 108,000 in 1900’. As Yale College grew into Yale University in 1900 it’s institutes, fraternities and residences were sited at and around 260 Crown Street between 1900-1920s. Before the automobile industry usurped the function of the block in the 1930’s, the proximity of 260 Crown to the city downtown and what would be the center of Yale University encouraged professors and students to rent in the area. From the 1930’s onwards the property as well as the street developed an intensely automobile centered culture, functioning as a parking garage, mechanics workshop and car rental. The businesses at this site have done well, as maps and directories reflect their expansion over time to occupy adjacent properties and long lease periods (Hertz, Lawlor, Professional Parking).

 

Yale Library’s Manuscript’s and Archives, 

White Brothers, Clark, Hall &amp; Peck Records

The oldest record of the building at the Yale Library’s Manuscript’s and Archives, in the White Brothers, Clark, Hall &amp; Peck Records, is of the will of Harry A. Leonard choosing to bequeath 260 Crown Street to New Haven Bank in trust, to reinvest the property as deemed fit and to use the income from his estate to pay for services, debt and to divide the remainder of the income in equal halves between his daughter and wife.  This income was to be paid in quarterly installments.  He passed away on the 10 of January 1930, at which point the bank took control of his property and executed his will. At the time of his death only his daughter survived him. Mr. Leonard left $6000 to two sisters and an additional $1000 to a children’s charity. The records include short transcripts describing the leasing of the property over time.

The next set of records show the resolution of a dispute between Joseph W McLaughlin and Hertz Corporation between April and October 1973. In 1967 Joseph W McLaughlin purchased the Lawlor property 260-266 Crown Street from J. Boone Wilson who was the Trustee for the stockholders of the Lawlor Corporation. At the time Mr. McLaughlin purchased the land he assumed that the tanks and pumps were part of the sale price. The Hertz Corporation had leased the property since 1957 for 10 years until it was purchased by Mr. McLaughlin.  The Corporation stated the said property (tanks, pumps) belonged to Mobil and that they should be remunerated for costs. This matter was investigated on behalf of Mr. McLaughlin by Clark, Hall and Peck. Through a letter from the Cities Service Oil Co to Mr. McLaughlin the Corporation claims $943 in associated costs in 1973.

The earliest documentation is of an extension of the lease to Mr. Carlos Witcher in 1936 to rent the property at 4000$ per annum for an additional year. The property when rented to the Hertz Corporation in 1957, for a duration of ten years, stated rent per annum to be $12000 for the first 5 years of the term and $13,000 for the latter five year period of the term. Thus the rent at 260 Crown Street tripled in a period of about twenty years between 1936-1957.

A letter, dated October 1973, from the previous lawyer Francais R Peisch stated that he did not have any records that might assist in resolving this dispute, as the lease of property by Mr. Peter P Lawlor in 1957 to Hertz Corporation did not describe the installation of any tanks or pumps. This could mean that the infrastructure existed at the time or that no records of its installation by Hertz were preserved. On this letter to Clark, Hall and Peck from Francis Peisch, is a hand written note in additional to his formal type written letter that reads, ‘I have seen other oil companies pull things like this before!’','[]','','The building structure has survived from the early1920’s through alterations and minor changes in use since.

Short Description/ Narrative: 

The historical uses and re-uses of 35 Crown Street highlights the different manifestations of New Haven’s Ninth Square as a center for shops and industry over the course of the last century. Back in the early 20th century, the corner of Ninth Square bordered the New Haven Harbor and the mouth of the Farmington Canal. Today, the corner of Ninth Square borders another transportation hub: the State street train station, and serves as a point of entry for visitors coming in from the New Haven Union Station. Although the transportation mode has evolved, the square and its environs continue to serve as a stop on what Brinkerhoff Jackson calls “The Stranger’s Path,” and as a place of shops and industry on the stranger’s route from transportation hub to uptown New Haven.

In the mid 19th century, the area west of Crown and State in Ninth Square was home to a large carriage factory, residential units, and small family practices. A dentist, John J. Stone, who advertised “teeth of a superior quality”, owned the lot currently called 35 Crown Street (Figure 5). Later on, in or around 1900, Lea Hammond built the current building as a residential unit (Figure 8). As the city became more populated, and increased use of the waterways as a transportation hub drove foot traffic to increase as well in Ninth Square, the character of the shops in the square changed as well. By the mid 20th century, the area west of Crown and State had largely become a neighborhood of small shops selling food products and offering printing services. It was at this time that 35 Crown Street transformed into a retail location, first in 1913 into the “Chocolate Food Company Sugarbroker,” and then from 1915-1935 into the “Booth &amp; Law Company,” a distributor of varnishes, paints, and oils (City Directories).

The longevity of “Booth &amp; Law Company’s” stay at 35 Crown Street was not unusual in the area in the mid 20th century—well-established printers, paper companies, and engravers were also long-standing tenants of Ninth Square. The Depression, however, took its toll and by 1940, 35 Crown Street was a vacant storefront along with 28-36 Crown (City Directory). The next tenants also enjoyed relatively long stays: Michael Beckonstin operated the “Eastern Liquor Company Inc.” at 35 Crown from 1948-1963, and Moss &amp; Son operated the Connecticut Window and House Cleaning Company successfully from 1963-1999 (City Directories).

The current aesthetic of New Haven’s Ninth Square was the result of a city-driven urban renewal project in the late 1980s and early 90s. The site had been proposed for redevelopment in 1960 as a festive marketplace, but a lack of investor interest prevented that plan from moving forward. A 1982 push by local politicians helped the area achieve a historical district status, which made development in Ninth Square eligible for a federal tax credit. By the time city planners set to designing another comprehensive plan for the area, they had learned to preserve the historical facades of buildings during redevelopment. This city-driven renewal project that brought about 530 units of housing with affordable housing requirements known today as the “Residences of Ninth Square” was therefore one that kept the original terra cotta façade of 35 Crown Street visually intact.

The increased sensibility of city planners towards historical preservation did not prevent the short-term dilapidation of New Haven’s Ninth Square. Before construction started on this renewal project, in 1987, only 2 vacant storefronts existed on Orange Street from Court through State Street. By 1995, only 1 business on that street remained open (City Directories). The Connecticut Window and House Cleaning Company occupied 35 Crown Street during the time of this renewal project, and saw the transformation of small shops into vacant storefronts during its tenancy (City Directory).

Today Ninth Square enjoys special designation not only as a historical district but also as a business improvement district where storefronts pay additional taxes in exchange for additional city services on their streets. Festivals like “Breatheon9” and “FitWeekon9” are regularly offered, and foot traffic has increased not just with the Residences of Ninth Square but also with the opening of 360 State, a condominium building with a similar affordable housing program, but built by a private developer. 35 Crown Street’s current occupants, Gray Organschi Architecture, now sit across from a cozy coffee shop and next to the popular bar and music recording studio housed in the old firehouse. As architects and designers, this firm has itself a critical role to play in redesigning its surroundings—Gray Organschi’s projects include renovating the recording room in its neighboring Firehouse 12 and doing the interior of a high-end New Haven restaurant Barcelona.','[]','','1900','[]','[]','Unknown, current exterior wall addition by Gray Organschi Architecture','','35 Crown St, New Haven, CT','41.3040253','','[\'Heading down Crown Street\']','None');

It has housed four tenants – Porter’s Market, Meat King Market, H. M. Bullard’s Furniture, and, since 1968, Harold’s Formal Wear.

Previously, a larger building stood on the site. Research at the Whitney Library provided some information on its use. It was owned by a fraternal order that kept space in the building. There was space enough to rent units to tenants. In 1940, tenants included R. Anderson, Optician, and the Apollo Singing Society. In 1946, the fraternal building’s last year, the Singing Society still rented space, along with the Dawn Club Bible Students Association and the First Church of Christ, Spiritualist.[1]

On June 4, 1946, a permit was filed with the City of New Haven to construct a “one story masonry building” on the site.[2] The building, a low-slung, concrete, commercial structure, was designed by noted New Haven architect R. W. Foote and built by Fusco-Amatrudo contractors to be the home of Porter’s Market at a cost of $70,000. A grocery store remained on the site for sixteen years. By 1960, that store was named Meat King Market. [3]

In 1963, the building was bought by H. M. Bullard’s furniture company. According to the New Haven Directory, 19 Elm St. was used as a “clearance center,” suggesting that it was a showroom.[4] A mid-1960s photograph (Fig. 1) shows a building on the corner of Elm Street and State Street. Atop is a billboard for Bullard’s, and in the extreme left of the frame, if I\'m not mistaken, the edge of the building at 19 Elm can be seen. Notably, the image on the billboard is of a building never on the 19 Elm site, suggesting Bullard’s had more than one property.

In 1967, 19 Elm changed hands again. It was bought by Harold Pellegrino as the site for his formal wear store. A permit was filed for an extensive interior renovation on December 5, 1967.[5] The renovation was meant to clear the interior for its new purpose as a clothing store. The architect of record was Alden Berman and the contractor Red Pellegrino. The renovation was slated to cost $79,000. As a result of the remodeling, the building was downgraded from a fire resistive (Type II) building to an ordinary masonry (Type IV) building.

On October 7, 1975, Pellegrino filed another permit, for the addition of a small masonry module in the rear of the building to house a computer room. The addition was built by contractor Robert Fers and cost $3,000.[6]

The last notable modification to 19 Elm Street was filed with the Building Office on June 20, 1980. It called for a complete rebuilding of the façade, including the removal of a concrete bulkhead, and the construction of a new aluminum frame and plate glass windows. Almost certainly, this renovation led to the construction the swooping faux-awning that makes Harold’s such a distinctive building on the block. The project’s contractor was Anthony Aceto, A&amp;L Contractors, Inc., and the cost was $30,200.[7]

As of October, 2013, Harold\'s Formal Wear continues to occupy 19 Elm Street.

My mom loved the pasticiotti, little muffin-looking confections that exploded with vanilla cream and a puff of powdered sugar. They used to joke that going to Lucibello’s was like stepping into a time capsule. “No one makes pastries anymore like they do,” my grandpa always said. He refused to go anywhere else.

It turns out my mom and grandpa were more right about Lucibello’s time-capsule qualities than they could have imagined. Almost nothing has changed about the building or business since the Faggio family moved in 1962 to the wedge of land where Grand Avenue slices through Olive Street. In fact, the only change between the blueprints in the New Haven Building Department and the present-day building is the absence of built-in flower pots on the Grand Avenue side. (A new roof was installed in 2000 at a cost of $7500.)

In 1962, Lucibello’s new building (built at a cost of $22,500) was less of a time capsule than a glimpse into the future. As lot B-11 of the Mayor Dick Lee’s Wooster Square Redevelopment Project, the building represented a new vision for New Haven. The project was critical for Mayor Lee. In building the highway, he hoped to clear one of the cities poorest and most deteriorated area as well as ingratiate himself with the hard-to-crack Italian Republican stronghold of Wooster Square. To that end, his administration worked incredibly closely with the Wooster Square Renewal Committee to ensure the Italian community’s needs were met at all steps of the project.

Lucibello’s is a testament to that attention to detail. From its founding in 1929, the bakery had been located on the ground floor of a traditional four-story building on Chapel Street—directly in the path of the new Interstate. Though most of the surrounding neighborhood was considered blighted and later destroyed, the Lee administration recognized Lucibello’s as a pillar of the neighborhood’s Italian community and gave it arguably the best location on Grand Avenue, the strip designated for commercial activity in the Redevelopment Project. It stands there now, as it did even more so then, as a gateway to the neighborhood— a declaration and demarcation of the neighborhood’s ethnic history.

Just as Lucibello’s new building served as a link to the Italian community, so too did it represent a link to the new New Haven as a whole. The building’s clean modernist lines—designed by Damuck and Painchaud, a New Haven firm led at the time by Yale grad Kelton Painchaud—place it in conversation with the iconic Fire Department headquarters building that looms large across the street. The aesthetic connection between the two buildings—between Lucibello’s oven chimney and the Fire Department’s hose tower, in particular—suggests Mayor Lee’s desire for a close bond between his administration and the community he hoped to win over. (It’s also possible that the Lucibello’s building functioned as a Trojan Horse for the Mayor’s development plans. That is, if the neighborhood’s favorite bakery looked new and modern, the neighborhood’s residents might be more comfortable supporting the mayor’s future modernization schemes.)

Examining the immediate area surrounding Lucibello’s site helps further contextualize the changes that Lucibello’s represented when it moved to the site. On the 1886 Sanborn Fire map, a brick-and-wood dwelling stood on the site surrounded by a few small businesses on Grand Avenue and well-spaced dwellings on Lyon Street one street away. By 1924, Grand Avenue appears to have developed into a tightly packed commercial strip. Though the same dwelling stood at the Lucibello’s site, the rest of the street was now filled with small stores, each one pressed up against the next. In 1954TK, the dwelling had been replaced with a stone gas station, suggesting the rise of automobility in the city. The rest of Grand Avenue remained heavily commercial, though some of the small storefronts had been combined into larger stores. Fast forward to the 1973 Sanborn Maps, and the neighborhood had changed drastically in the post-Redevelopment era. Surrounding Lucibello’s were a few big stores and many large parking lots, designed of course, to lure in suburban shoppers back into the city.

We now know the legacy of that decision. While Wooster Square fared better than many other neighborhoods thanks to its Renewal Committee made up of locals, it’s hardly the bustling commercial district it once was. And while there are relics of the area’s Italian past—Lucibello’s itself, as well as Pepe’s, Sally’s and Libby’s on Wooster Street—today they are more reminders of a past than representations of the neighborhood’s current reality. Perhaps most tellingly, Peter Faggio, Lucibello’s third generation owner laughed when I asked him if his family still lived in the neighborhood. “No, no,” he told me. “I live in Durham with my family. We moved out a long time ago.” To get to work, he takes I-91.','[]','','July 27, 1962','[\'Wooster\']','[]','Damuck and Painchaud','','935 Grand Avenue, New Haven, CT, 06511','41.3075609','','[\'Grand Avenue: Gateway to Fair Haven\']','[]','[]','None');

	1973: 1 Property - Crown St. Garage (NH Parking Authority)

Short Description / Narrative:  Since 1970, 215 Crown St. has been the site of the Crown Garage Building [Fig 1], part of a group of garages developed during the 1960s -1970s by the New Haven Parking Authority as an initiative to solve parking shortages in the Downtown area. The building was designed by the firm Granberry Cash &amp; Associates, highly active in New Haven, and responsible for Friendship Houses, a two-story housing complex at Wooster Square [Fig. 8]. It echoes urbanistic moves in Paul Rudolph’s 1961 Temple Street Garage by using a ground-level arcade to mediate its relation with the street; yet its ability to draw pedestrians from four sides of the block[1], and its modular construction techniques, should be recognized as an example of quality public development in downtown New Haven. The Crown Garage is one of the most salient elements along the street-front, both in terms of sheer volume -occupying most of the street-front within its block (209-217 Crown)-, as in terms of use -750 parking places make it one of the most frequented public facilities in the zone-. The Building is also home to two large nightclubs located at street-level, and generally services parking demands for nearby cafes, restaurants, and theaters.The Schubert, among those adjacent, dates to the time when the lot of Crown Garage was occupied by 18 separate structures. Insurance Maps of the turn of the 20th Century [Fig.2] show ten detached homes and buildings partially surrounding a skating rink at the core of the block. Already in 1920, the urban facade of the street presented a consolidated front, and the rink at the interior of the block had shifted its program to accommodate increasing demands for parking space in downtown New Haven [Fig.2]. Access to the new ‘auto-storage’ remained by means of an alley on the opposite side of the block (Chapel Street Front), which used to serve as the path to the original 19th Century skating rink. Since 1924 [Fig.3], buildings within the current site of the Crown Street Garage started to be taken over by the programmatic requirements of the expanding ‘auto-storage’, responding to a general trend of garage space development in the downtown area at the time. Incidentally, a significant part of the current building site used to be occupied by informal garages from the early 20s. These reconditioned buildings would remain in use until their closure in 1970, for the development of Crown Garage [Fig.4]. Such continuities in terms of the site’s use provide interesting aspects for further research, as the transition from informal parking spaces into large-scale public parking is a marked trend within the block’s real-estate dynamics.

Situated on a short commercial block of Court Street between Orange Street and State Street, historically, the high-rise 126 Court Street office Building had been general and executive headquarters of Southern New England Telephone Company since late 19th century. The Southern New England Telephone Company was incorporated and in 1889 bought its first real estate that occupied what is now 124 to 126 Court Street, but the original building was what appeared to be Chicago-style 3 stories decorated with Romanesque-arched windows and had base-middle-head structure for a facade. The old office was demolished to give room for a 10-story office building of Beaux Arts Classical style. Designed by Leoni W. Robinson, the building towered over its neighborhood when it was first erected in 1918 (construction begun in 1916) and was the tallest building in New Haven. The Federal office building stands just west of it.

Building and Style 

When first built in 1916, the Beaux Arts Classical building tower was 10 stories high and square in floor plan and its exterior was surprisingly plain in appearance compared to other buildings of same architectural style (e.g. Union Station in New Haven, Grand Central Station in New York City). Despite its simplicity, it nevertheless carries obvious characteristics of Beaux Arts decoration, such as, symmetry, flat rooftop, cartouche (oval or oblong design with a slightly concave) on the first floor windows, garland, a decorative cord, around the edge of it, and balusters (also known as spindles, stair sticks) on the roof top.

Expansion and Alteration 

 The building went through significant alteration in 1929. The redesign of the building was done by Roy W. Foote and carried out by Dwight Building Company: two additional stories were added and a small building occupying the street-side location was demolished. A 12-story wing was also added to the original square building, giving it an L-shaped plan. It’s longtime occupant, Southern New England Telephone Company’s ultimate plan was to expand its headquarter on 126 Court Street 3 times as big as it was, but the plan was since abandoned. In 1937 Southern New England Telephone Company outgrew its space in the building and moved to a larger building oat 223 Church Street. The Art Deco new headquarter was designed by Douglas Orr and Roy W. Foote which then became the tallest building in its days. In 1955, aluminum sheathing was added to protect the building from moisture.

Southern New England Telephone Company and the building

Southern New England Telephone Company has been the major occupant of 126 Court Street building tower since its erection in 1916. During 1888, SNET Company purchased its first piece of real estate, a lot on Court Street, and during 1889 completed the erection of a 3-story general office building, the third floor of which became the quarters of the operating room in New Haven division. This was subsequently enlarged and served as general headquarter. Spacious as the new headquarter seemed, it was soon evident that with the demand for telephone services constantly increasing, a separate building would be required in New Haven for the operating and maintenance forces. In 1902, work was started on a building in Pitkin Street (which was then south of Court Street, between Orange and State Street and now no longer exists), and in 1904 the city of New Haven was served from the new building. In 1917, again, the company found itself needing more room and the roof of the Pitkin Street building was raised to make a third floor. In the spring of 1916, construction of a 10-story building, the first unit of an ultimate three section building of 12 stories was begun at the Court Street location, and was occupied in October 1917. Early in 1927, 2 stories were added to this first unit to equal in height with the adjacent second unit of 12 stories which was the in the process of construction. There two 12-story units comprise the then operating building at 114 Court Street. In February 1937, after the demolition of three old buildings, SNET Company started excavate staff from Court Street building to the new building on 223 Church Street. When the company moved its offices to the new building, the Court Street building tower was converted entirely to electronic switching operations. The sheathing was added in 1955 to protect the equipment from moisture which was penetrating the masonry facade. The building became obsolete in the 1970s with the construction of the SNET Co. building at the corner of Court and State Streets.

Redevelopment under Urban Development Action Grant (UDAG)

In early 1980s, Development Corporation of Greenwich, CT. called for the restoration of the 1929 facade and the conversion of interior space to commercial and residential uses. For the period January 1980 to June 1984, the City of New Haven saw a dramatic rise in the level of new investments occurring throughout the downtown area. Within this period, approximately $209 million dollars has been invested in downtown New Haven and immediate vicinity, $55 million was under construction, and $48 million was scheduled for construction within the following six months. Over $300 million dollars would be invested in the center city by early 1984. The Center Court project, receiving $6.7 million dollars which would be invested in the conversion of the SNET Company building at 126 Court Street, was to begin in the spring of 1984. The first 3 floors of the building would be shops and offices, the upper floors would yield 74 market-rate apartment units, 12 of which would be subsidized by the project’s cash flow and made available to low and moderate income tenants. A landscaped court would be created at the rear of the building. The project had the support of the City and the Downtown Council as well as SNET Company. Developer for Center Court was Landmark Development Corporation of America in collaboration of Maitland.Staus/Behr of Greenwich Developer.','[]','','1916','[\'Downtown\']','[]','Leoni W.

The new building filled in the historical gap between the Imperial Granum building (47 Elm Street) and the James Cook house (35 Elm Street), having laid empty except for a small one-story brick addition to the Imperial Granum building constructed in 1901. The new storefronts sold quickly to three family businesses, highlighting the need for commercial space in downtown New Haven in the 1950s: AD Perkins Rubber Stamps Company (the Schroff family), Lundblad Jeweler’s (Donald and Louise Lundblad) and Anderson’s Opticians (Rudolph and Alice Anderson). Typical of the 1950s, the original storefronts used neon signs to attract foot traffic. As the only original tenant remaining, AD Perkins has preserved its original façade, complete with a hanging neon sign visible perpendicular to the sidewalk. A 1951 permit filed by Rudolph Anderson describes a “metal box neonized projecting sign” that cost $50, indicating that the optician had used a similar sign to attract customers.

As the original tenants aged and passed away, their long-standing businesses were replaced. After 30 years in business, Anderson’s Opticians was replaced by Copy Graphic for 6 years before the space was renovated for food handling. A mother-and-daughter bakery, Le Gourmet Extraordinaire opened in 1987 by Anita and Patricia Francis. The pair offered baked goods and lunch for take-out, as well as catering. 10 years later, a small taco joint called Dos Tacos opened at 39 Elm Street, also offering very little eat-in space. Around the same time, in 1995, Lundblad Jeweler’s closed its doors after over 44 years in business, clearing the way for a chiropractor who gained much of his business from nearby personal injury law offices. Dos Tacos lasted less than 5 years before being replaced by the Nile restaurant, a Mediterranean restaurant run by an Egyptian man who had previously worked as a manager in a well-known New Haven restaurant. After only a year or so in business, however, the Nile restaurant closed, having garnered little business, marking it as the shortest lasting tenant in the building’s history.

In 2003 a Korean family from Queens purchased both 39 and 41 Elm Street. The family opened Fashion Nail and Spa at 41 Elm Street, while renting 39 Elm Street to a Chinese family who opened Fresh Taco. The 2003 purchase is part of a larger trend in recent New Haven history of increasing Korean store ownership in the city. Both stores demonstrate how Asian American communities use metropolitan hubs (in this case Queens) as launching pads for opening businesses in nearby smaller cities and towns. For instance, the renovation of the two stores was outsourced to New York City. Fresh Taco brought in a contractor from Chinatown in Manhattan to do alterations after purchasing the building. They also had their sign built and installed by a company in Flushing, Queens, an area known for its large Asian population. The awning at Fashion Nail and Spa also came from a company based in Queens.

Both Fresh Taco and Fashion Nail and Spa have been in business for over 10 years, longer than any other former tenants besides the original owners of the building. Fashion Nail and Spa is always busy with clients, ranging from Yale students to New Haven residents, even Yale College Dean Mary Miller. Fresh Taco has also maintained a respectable business, gaining much of its business from local residents. After a high turnover rate in the 1990s and early 2000s, 39 and 41 Elm Street have now stabilized, marking a new era for the building. Following general economic trends, the building began as three retail locations in the 1950s, gradually switching to service-oriented businesses following the rise of the strip mall. While much has changed in the buildings history, one fact remains: just as in 1951, all three tenants are family businesses.

Responding to a booming post-World War II economy, the block of Elm Street between Orange and State Street became increasingly commercial in the 1950s. The block, once a “fashionable residential neighborhood” in the 1800s according to the Preservation Trust, started to accumulate more commercial activity. Seeing the potential for development, Loeb &amp; Sons spent $26,000 in 1951 to build a three-storefront commercial building made of cinder blocks and plaster walls and covering 39, 41, and 43 Elm Street. The new building filled in the historical gap between the Imperial Granum building (47 Elm Street) and the James Cook house (35 Elm Street), having laid empty except for a small one-story brick addition to the Imperial Granum building constructed in 1901. The new storefronts sold quickly to three family businesses, highlighting the need for commercial space in downtown New Haven in the 1950s: AD Perkins Rubber Stamps Company (the Schroff family), Lundblad Jeweler’s (Donald and Louise Lundblad) and Anderson’s Opticians (Rudolph and Alice Anderson). Typical of the 1950s, the original storefronts used neon signs to attract foot traffic. As the only original tenant remaining, AD Perkins has preserved its original façade, complete with a hanging neon sign visible perpendicular to the sidewalk. A 1951 permit filed by Rudolph Anderson describes a “metal box neonized projecting sign” that cost $50, indicating that the optician had used a similar sign to attract customers.

The building that stood at what is now #33 was the office of John J. Stone, who advertised in a local paper that he was “now prepared to set Teeth of very superior quality, (better than ever before in New Haven.)”  Living next door at about the same time was Billy Goodwin, who occupied #17 Crown and was noted in the paper for being “an Englishman by birth, and noted for his genial good nature.”  By 1886, Goodwin’s house was demolished for a large, multistory brick residence, which was in turn demolished by 1901 to make way for a C.S. Mersick & Co. warehouse.  Mersick, a hardware manufacturer and metal dealer, had occupied lots on State Street for several years.  The company expanded, as the century turned and American industry accelerated, into a new brick warehouse, complete with an elevator and several floors, each devoted to a different specialty. The first floor made bicycles, the second floor was involved with printing, and the third and fourth floors held a corset factory.  The frame house next door remained, but was now divided in three, holding a store, a dwelling, and a barbershop.


Some time between 1901 and 1911, C.S. Mersick conceded some space on Crown Street to the Blakeslee Block, which housed a variety of industries under the Blakeslee name.  The precise function of the company is unknown, but the Blakeslee Block did include such varied enterprises as real estate company and a locksmith.  Blakeslee continued to occupy certain spaces on Crown Street, even as Mersick expanded its footprint to include by 1924 another warehouse, next door to the previously erected one and occupying the site that is currently Acme.  Like its counterpart, this new warehouse was made of brick, and the two buildings were joined in the middle by a set of iron doors and two central elevators.','4','33 Crown Street is a brick architecture currently houses Acme Office Furniture Inc., a company thich is a vendor of vintage office furniture.','[]','Though records are not conclusive about the year the building was constructed or who occupied it immediately after its construction, 33 Crown resembles buildings in the surrounding area that were built in the early 20th century, with renovations from around the 1950s on the ground floor windows and doors.

In 1830, the Ransom Burritt Grocery and Provision Store occupied the corner of George and Chapel, and in 1842, Morris Charles, a shoemaker, resided on the west side near York Street. Rowhouses dotted George Street at the turn of the century as urbanization occurred; the city built a trolley on George Street sometime after 1910. In 1886, 350 George Street was a small, two-story, wooden structure. Dorothea Schmidt, widower of William K., acquired the property in 1901, and it measured 60 x 150 feet. She still resided there in 1916 along with Anna C. Dickson and Frank Morris when the block was entirely residential. Schmidt occupied the property in the late 1910s, but left after falling behind on her taxes in 1917.

Commercial businesses and services moved onto the street in the 1920s. In 1920, Hares Motors of Connecticut occupied 350 George. In 1925, the surrounding lots were still partially residential: a dentist at 336, Lewis Kimberly living at 340, a vacancy at 356. By this time, another motor company, Fergus Motors Corp., operated on the lot. The structure was made out of brick, and a sales room fronted George Street, with a garage in the back.

George Street’s buildings underwent significant structural and programmatic change in the 1930s. Vacancies on the entire block in 1935, except for the Packard Sales and Service store at 350, reflect this transformation. Brick buildings had replaced rowhouses, and by 1945, the block was an automobile service district. Along with the Packard Sales and Service depot, Fred’s Auto Body and Fender, Paradise Gasoline, and the Byron Tire Company conducted business.

Urban Renewal in the 1950s brought about more change to the Oak Street Connector area. Officials demolished Oak Street and in its place constructed the Rt. 34 Connector, displacing residents, homes, and small businesses. In 1957, Southern New England Telephone Company and architect Douglas Orr constructed a modern office building at the corner of College and George (300 George Street). The original building used porcelain enamel panels for the walls and cut sandstone blocks for the facing material. SNET also acquired the rest of the city block (350 George Street) and converted it into a parking lot.

SNET developed the parking lot at 350 George Street in 1977-79, constructing a building for data processing and office space. Architecture firm Russell, Gibson, von Dohlen oversaw the construction of the three-story, concrete office building and four-story parking garage (at 340 George Street); the project cost about $2.5 million.

The SNET/Douglass Orr building still exists today at 300 George Street and contains laboratory, research, and office space. 350 George Street still operates as a part of AT&amp;T, and contains office space, publishing equipment, and data facilities.','[]','','1977-1979','[]','[]','Russell, Gibson, von Dohlen','','350 George Street, New Haven, CT 06510','41.3057319','','[\'Preservation & Renewal towards Trowbridge Square\']','None');

Today, the site contains the two identical, sixteen story residential towers with 238 units each, a parking garage for tenants, as well as a small pool.

Originally, the University Towers block was part of the Oak Street Redevelopment Project, adopted in December of 1955 by the City of New Haven. The Oak Street Project’s largest goal was the introduction of the Oak Street Connector, but also designated land use restrictions for the surrounding area, including residential, commercial-industrial, commercial, and institutional. According to the proposed land use plan, the site of University Towers was intended for residential use (Image 1).

Previous to the Oak Street Redevelopment Project the block encased by York St., Crown St., Park St., and George St., was dominated by residential and commercial use. Looking at maps provided by Sanborn Fire Insurance Company we can map the use of the land up until the project was initiated (Images, 2, 3, 4). In 1900, two-story, single-family wooden houses and row houses joined by Webster Public School, an Episcopalian Church, and a Woodwork and Repository Office dominated the block. In 1911 we see a few changes telling of the increasing level of industrialization: the presence of Mutual Realty Co. owning several lots of land, the appearance of Farmington Savings Bank and individuals like “G.A. Dale” who own more than one property. These distinctions are telling in that the most likely explanation is that the single-family houses in the block were beginning to rent to multiple families. This reflects the larger trend of an increase of population and decrease in average income that took place in New Haven during the industrialization. In 1924, we see the appearance of two new garages, expressing the automobile boom during the time. Along with the garages we see the introduction of a new church and a transformation of the Woodwork &amp; Repository Office into an Automobile Painting Company entitled E.W. Baldwin &amp; Son Inc. In whole, the block maintained a mostly residential land use, with the inclusion of a few commercial facilities. By looking at a map of the land use immediately prior to the initiation of the Oak Street Redevelopment (Image 6) we can see that during the years from 1924-1958 little changed. We see the commercial land spreading to cover more area within the block, and we also confirm our guess that most of the houses on the block had been converted from single-family dwellings into multi-family residences.

On March 12th, 1958 the leasehold agreement regarding the land in the Oak Street Redevelopment Project was signed for the residential blocks. From this point on the city had rights to use eminent domain to obtain the entire block for the two residential towers. (NOTE: I misunderstood this part of the narrative prior to my oral report. The buildings existing previously were grouped under the name “Corporation A” in the lease agreement documents, but there, in fact, were several different owners, not just one hegemony. The land use map of the Oak Street Redevelopment Plan proves this.). The City then continued on to demolish the entire site, and began construction of the residential towers.

Robert Allan Jacobs of Kahn &amp; Jacobs Architects, a prominent New York architecture office during the time period, designed the original University Towers. With only two towers on an entire city block, the buildings allow for an impressive amount of air and light into the site and the buildings. The parking garage was also part of the original plans for the building. The towers, 16 stories each, were to be for residential use, with the exception of the first floor of each building, which had been designated for commercial use. At the time, this commercial use was cited as being intended, specifically, for medical offices and remains largely so until today. In November of 1958, the City of New Haven had agreed to University Towers as the owners of the two towers and surrounding land and on September 14th, 1961 the City handed over the buildings and all accompanying rights to University Towers, Inc.

Over the years, adjustments to the lease and to the buildings themselves were made in order to adapt to an evolving city. From the time of completion until today, both towers have undergone small construction changes including moving of non-load bearing walls, upgraded windows, heating, plumbing and similar adjustments allowing for the buildings to remain desirable for living. More notably, In 1981 New Haven Towers and Associates bought the rights for the Park Street side tower and renamed it “Madison Tower”. The Tower at 111 Park stayed a rental tower, while the York Street side tower entered into cooperative ownership. Consequentially, today the New Haven Towers owned building caters to a lower-income mass than does the University Towers building. The 111 Park Street tower caters mostly to younger New Haven residents, while the 100 York Street tower caters to mostly Yale Graduate Students and the elderly. Despite the difference in the demographics of residents, both towers have been able to maintain over a 95% occupancy rate for the past several years. In addition, both towers have maintained the use of the first level for commercial operations and continue to host mainly medical offices.

Like the Court Street Rowhouses Gabrielle Brainard writes of, the University Towers have sustained a profitable, enduring presence. By utilizing an adaptable structure, advantageous land placement, and accommodating a changing market, the University Towers have survived for 50 years and dare us to guess when they will fail.','[]','','1959-1960','[]','[]','Kahn & Jacob Architects (Robert Jacobs)','','100 York St, New Haven, CT 06510','41.3069846','','[\'Preservation & Renewal towards Trowbridge Square\']','None');

From the weathering of snow, rain and sun, to restorations and façade changes, the elevation of a structure can gives the viewer glimpses of the previous lives of a building. With two large garage doors clearly visible, the façade of 464 Congress tells us that the building has had a history of being used as a manufacturing facility. Also, from the decorative ornamentation and relatively clean façade, the viewer can infer that the building has undergone a type of renovation in the past twenty five years. These clues give us a small snapshot into the life of 464 Congress.   According to the earliest sanborn maps of New Haven, during the late 19th century and early 20th century, the surrounding area of 464 Congress began to undergo a series of changes and transitions from a residential area into a mixed-use and manufacturing hub for the developing city of New Haven. In 1886, the area maintained a large working-class neighborhood that supported smaller privately owned stores and shops. 464 Congress, in 1886, was adjacent to a drugstore, as well as housed its own private saloon. In addition, directly to the south of the site was a street, Stevens Street, that appears on earlier sanborn maps. This disappearing street is a testament to the residential character that was once 464 Congress. Stevens Street was a minor artery that most likely served as a “convenience street,” created to reduce travel distances; however, never serving as a major artery for street traffic.   The turn of the century brought about a new trend in the surrounding area. With more families moving into the area, stores and artisans began to settle down and create a business-like environment that promoted early development. From this, an early commercial strip began to appear. With the budding city of New Haven only a number of blocks away, Congress Avenue began to serve as a thorough-fare, connecting the residential band of the city to New Haven’s growing downtown. However, this only lasted for a period of about twenty years; the New Haven manufacturing boom pushed out small enterprise and created an entirely new market for growth along Congress Avenue. The turn of the century brought a New Haven manufacturing boom that lasted approximately fifty years. With large manufacturers moving into the area, such as the Baumann Rubber Company in 1924, the area became increasingly more commercial, until a new owner purchased a number of properties in the area and began to change the character of the area into a mixed-use development. Charles Rosenstein of Los Angeles began purchasing property in the area during the 1950s and extended the site into the adjacent building. Similar development happened in subsequent years, until in 1973, the Yale School of Medicine purchased 464 Congress Avenue, and its sister building 470 Congress Avenue.   Timeline: 1886: Site used to house a saloon along a commercial strip with multiple smaller mixed use buildings. 1901: Wood frame buildings start to appear; still smaller stores dominate the area. 1911: A strong number of wooden structural buildings are present, creating a commercial strip. 1924:Dense Manufacturing Area 1950: Purchased by Charles Rosenstein 1973: Purchased by the Yale School of Medicine','[]','','','[]','[]','','','464 Congress Avenue, New Haven, CT, 06510','41.3007106','','[\'Preservation & Renewal towards Trowbridge Square\']','None');

It is a small brick building, located at the corner of Howe Street and Edgewood Avenue.

Records of the properties ownership, found at Sterling Manuscripts and Archives, date back to 1836, before there was any construction on the site. Between 1836 and 1905 when the present building was constructed, the property changed ownership a number of times. It was held for long periods of time in the hands of Robert K. Beach who handed it over to family members for short time periods throughout the 19th century. The first owner of the property once a building was placed on the site was Charles S. Leavenworth.

According to documents from 1984, the building was designated part of the Dwight Street Historic District. It was described as ‘ca. 1905 Commercial. Brick with concrete block storefront. 2 stories. Flat roof. Metal-trimmed fixed window panes with narrow casement side lights typical of early commercial style.’ It was one of the last buildings to be constructed between 65 and 115 Howe Street, which seems odd, as it is on a corner and would thus receive more traffic.

Between its construction and eventual purchase by today’s owner in 1964, the building again exchanged hands a number of times. It was used by the Caloric Furnace Company from 1920 – 1926 and The Mack Truck Motor Company from 1926 – 1927; It was contracted to The Frantham Corporation on April 18th, 1938 who leased it to Frank Rubino, contracted again by the Frantham Corporation on April 17th 1959, and contracted by Windsor Realty Co. on July 31st, 1961. During this time it was appraised at $24045 in 1948, $28370 in 1958 and later $32000 in 1967.

Pizza House was established on the site in 1964 and is still the present operator using the building. The restaurant was first owned by John Papadoupulas and after him his son Nicholas Papadoupoulos, the owner today. I walked over to the building myself and it appears to have the original signage intact from its inception. The inside looks to have been renovated once since 1964, but I was not quite sure when. I tried some of the pizza from Pizza House but sadly the portions were small and not very good, a possible reason why I had never heard of the pizza shop before. Today the property including the buildings and land is assessed at $178150. It is zoned for mixed use, and the 2nd floor above the shop is finished and looks to be used for offices of some type.','[]','','1836-1905','[\'Dwight-Edgewood\']','[]','','','89 Howe St, New Haven, CT','41.3104651','','[\'Historic Chapel West and Dwight Edgewood\']','None');

In 1924, the plot that is now home to 35-57 College Street, known collectively as 35 College Street or the College Plaza Building, was home to a collection of small, densely packed factories on a commercial block filled with stores, a synagogue, and a few dwellings and flats. In this same year, plans were finalized for the Sterling Hall of Medicine at the Yale Medical School on the block opposite this one.

The two story 35 College Street was later built in 1957. The oldest found record on this building comes from 1974, when a uniform and book store secured a permit to make repairs to their shop at 45 College Street. Five years later in 1979, there is record of the same book and uniform store submitting a permit to move into a vacant store at the same address. While this small oddity could be attributed to a number of causes, it is possible that the center was unsuccessful for a time and later regained momentum in the late 70s.

In 1978, a firm by the name of Barrows and Wallace acquired a permit to install advertising, suggesting that by this point, the center was very commercial and that its tenants saw tending to their stores on this lot as a profitable investment.

Moving ahead into 1981, Domino’s Pizza moved in to replace what was being used as a health foods store at 43 College Street. Six years later, an establishment by the name of Dilligad Deli (see Figure 2 for plan) was transforming this former take-out space into a sit-down restaurant by installing counters at tables in the space. Notable here is that even while the occupant of this space changes, the building use remains constant.

By 1989 there is a growth in the number of tenants as the former book and uniform store is dismantled and converted into ten different stores on the first floor with offices on the second. Although the strip itself was mixed use from the 1970s on, this is the first time that one parcel in the center adopts this modern arrangement. The creation of these offices marks the first move in a series to shift of use of 35 College Street.

William Vishno, a lawyer and important figure in the history of 35 College Street, leased a property he then owned, 37 College Street, to Yale Facilities Management for office space in 1989, marking the beginning of his gradual take-over of most of the plaza. In 1990, Vishno converts retail stores at 53 College Street into a law office that he will occupy. A year later, 47 College Street becomes a two-story mixed use residential, retail, and office space, but Vishno continues his acquisition of properties in this strip when he gains propriety of 51 College Street around the same time. Perhaps it is because of this building’s proximity to the Sterling Hall of Medicine and other Yale Medical School buildings as well as Yale’s noted interest in their space (Yale Facilities Management building occupation) that Vishno continues to purchase these addresses.

Finally in November of 1995, the building was bought and occupied by Yale University and became the “College Plaza Building.” After several structural alterations, such as making the building basement handicapped accessible and adding two exterior side towers to the existing structure, the building was converted in 1996 from its then use of office space on the second floor, mercantile on the first floor, and storage in the basement to a lobby and elevator on the second floor, offices, a library, and a student lounge on the first floor, and Yale School of Epidemiology and Public Health space in the basement.

Today, the building functions entirely as office space for the Yale School of Epidemiology and Public Health. What began as an extension of commerce onto the other side of North Frontage Road became a booming commercial strip that was then gradually bought out by entrepreneur William Vishno and eventually sold to Yale University, essentially shifting the building’s use. 35 College Street used to be a conglomeration of different businesses, and at times residents and offices. Now it is one complex, under one name—College Plaza Building. Perhaps it is the building’s adaptability, like those of the row houses on Court Street, that has contributed to its ability to remain an integral part of the urban landscape. Or perhaps it’s the building’s proximity to the Yale Medical School. It is also possible that this change in use is symbolic of a change in the leading economic sector in New Haven, from small business to institutes of Higher Education and Medical Institutions (Eds and Meds). Whatever the case, this building has remained an important piece of the New Haven urban fabric and will likely continue to do so for years to come.

Despite my research, I was disappointed to have a gap between 1957 and 1973 for this building. Upon consulting with my boss from the summer at the Chamber of Commerce, we were able to locate the Redevelopment Plan for the Oak Street Redevelopment Area, which includes my building, 37-55 College Street. The plan was adopted in 1955 and according to this document at the time of print, was amended nine times through September of 1973. The block designated “Block I,” contained my building and was designated for commercial use. The standards for development on Block I were set to include a “minimum setback of fifteen feet from all lot lines,” and very strict rules on signage. Building use was also designated. The document stated that the only permissible uses for the space would be as professional offices, and limited retail use. Goals of this plan included elimination of high crime incidence and provision of easier access to the hospital through a sound area rather than a substandard one. While apart from recognizing that in 1973 a bank and a number of stores occupied the “College Plaza Building,” it remains unclear how the building was being used between 1957 and 1973. However, given this Redevelopment Plan, one might assume that perhaps the building’s tenants were not succeeding, leaving the area one in need of refurbishment to reaffirm the dignity of the area.','[]','','','[]','[]','','','35 College Street, New Haven, CT 06510','41.30290000000001','','[\'Preservation & Renewal towards Trowbridge Square\']','None');

1870s  On December 1, 1871, the New Haven Dispensary opens on 31 Crown Street, with the purpose of “supplying medicines and medical advice and assistance to such as may be sick and needy, in New Haven and its vicinity.” By 1874, the dispensary was serving nearly 1,600 mostly working-class patients yearly. The dispensary moves from its original Crown Street home to York Street in 1878.[i]

1880s  29-31 Crown Street is the home of Steele &amp; Emery, owned by Alexander Emery. As shown on the 1886 Sanborn Map, Steel &amp; Emery specializes in spices; “teas, coffees, spices, and fancy groceries form the principal articles sold.”[ii] Steele &amp; Emery thrives on 31 Crown, its trade extending “over a wide territory.” Steele &amp; Emery is particularly known for their “Czar Baking Powder” (right). The business fails by the 1890s.

1900s  31 Crown Street has a new occupant: Charles W. Foster, an enterprising businessman who establishes Charles W. Foster &amp; Co in 1877 and moves into 31 Crown by the mid-1890s. Charles W. Foster &amp; Co. manufactures “Corsets and Elastic Garment and Hose Supporters.”[iii] Foster sees his business become a great success: Foster corsets are heralded as “equal in every respect to the French corset, and cost much less in price,” a boon to practical New England women.[iv] The building has been transformed into a lively manufacturing hub, consisting of three floors and “fitted up with all the newest mechanical contrivances necessary.”[v] Foster expands his business to reselling Wolverine Stationary Motors, as advertised in an 1890s issue of the Hartford and Meridan News (left), and is well known as “an esteemed member of New Haven’s commercial circles.”[vi]

31 Crown Street exemplifies the industrious energy of early 20th century New Haven around this time: Foster hit his entrepreneurial peak just as the city started to accelerate in economic growth, buoyed by the Industrial Revolution.

1911    Jennie Rosenbluth now owns the property, according to historical records.[vii] In 1911 Jennie Rosenbluth is widowed, her husband Solomon deceased eight years prior.

When Jennie herself passes away in 1922, ownership of the property transfers to her sons Louis and Arthur. They are prolific characters in New Haven: Louis is a Yale Law School graduate, practicing lawyer and active in organizations such as the New Haven Community Foundation. At 28 Arthur is mentioned in the Bridgeport Herald for his enterprising plan to build enormous “ice houses,” designed to supply the city after a harrowing “ice famine” in 1905.[viii]

1912    The Rosenbluths lease the property to Joseph Greenberg, a German immigrant who founds ACME Moving &amp; Storage Company along with his brother Samuel.

1944    Louis Rosenbluth sells 29-33 Crown Street to Joseph Greenberg permanently. Since then, the property has remained under the ownership of the Greenberg family. Greenberg also runs his business out of four other buildings on State Street throughout the 1950s and 60s.

1960s  Once densely surrounded by buildings, 29-33 Crown Street now stands next to an empty lot. A contemporary investigation of the space reveals a parking lot at the site where a large warehouse once stood, according to Sanborn maps. The changing landscape evidences the prioritization of auto accessibility throughout the mid-20th century in New Haven, as older buildings are demolished to ease the movement of cars into the city.

2012    Now ACME Office Furniture, Greenberg’s business celebrates its 100th anniversary on 33 Crown Street, still operated by the Greenbergs: Alan, Joseph Greenberg’s son, and his son Robert.[ix] Since the 1960s, ACME has specialized in vintage furniture – a fitting niche for one of New Haven’s oldest businesses. 33 Crown Street simultaneously recalls the past while serving as an integral part of the revitalized and reenergized Ninth Square.

The upper and lower levels’ glass storefronts demonstrate the function was intended for retail or service, which the lease documents support.

In 1895, three people owned the building. It was divided between them, and each owner leased out his or her space. A certificate of title from Dec. 1897 listed the owners as Clara Oakley, Charles W. Knapp, and Frank H. Whittemore. The bounding land was owned by James M. Townsend, and by land formerly owned by Ariel Parish, by George Rich and Charles Skiff, and Peter R. Carll. I was not sure exactly the intent of the list at the base of the certificate – it seemed to record trustees or mortgages – a portion to Eliza M. Beers for $14,000, to Smith College for $25,000, Charle E. Brown, and taxes of 1896 and 1897. Also, at some point soon after, around 1901, it seems that partial ownership was deeded to Nathan Bronson.

The rest of the documents chronologically listed the leasers or new owners. In 1900, a portion of the building was to be used as a men’s furnishing store. The addresses in the manuscripts include the current neighboring building, but I am not sure if they were part of 1020 Chapel St. originally. In any case, their use reveals the environment of the block. The Store and basement known as 1008 Chapel St. was leased by Israel Kleimer and sons in 1900 as a tailoring establishment. Two other tailoring stores opened in 1012 and 1014 Chapel in 1906.

In 1909, Bronson leased 1016, 1018, and 1020 – now all called 1020, to Horrace F. Chase to be used as a men’s furnishing store. Numbers 1008-1020 were given to the trustee of Union and New Haven Trust Co. by Bronson, who then sold the building to Arthur Rosenburg for $350,000 in 1923. Rosenburg leased the building to White Inc. from 1928-1943 for retail, but only for men’s haberdashery, ready to wear clothes, jewelry, sporting goods and supplies; stipulated was that no boots, shoes, or other footwear by French Shriner be sold.

I also found the dimensions of the property from a survey done by Alexander Cahn Civil Engineer and Suveyor of New Haven in December, 1923. A blueprint showed the property to be a backwards L-shape, with the front facing Chapel Street at 87’-2”, the right side 132’-5”, the top, 18’-6”, the left side 61’-10” the top left 48’-10” and the bottom left side 70’-3.”

I stopped by City Hall, but the address 1020 Chapel Street returned no information. However, looking up close addressed, I discovered the building was actually listed as 1016. This reflects the overall ambiguity of the street address, as seen in the manuscripts and archives information. The information included that the building is a two story commercial space, used for retail, with a flat roof, brick walls, and vinyl/asphalt floors. It has a finished lower level and utility in addition to the first and second floors. The total living area is 8,756 square feet and the current value is $580,462.','[]','','1895','[\'Chapel West\']','[]','','','1020 Chapel Street, New Haven, CT','41.307252','','[\'Historic Chapel West and Dwight Edgewood\']','None');

In recent memory it has housed restaurants like Bespoke, Gilt, and Briq, which occupied the whole building, including the roof deck. 

In its early history, it was referred to as a “college eatery” in business directories. The most notable era in this building’s life was its time as Kaysey’s Restaurant, from 1935 to 1968.  Kaysey\'s may have adapted some of the Spanish Renaissance Revival styling of the building, incorporating decorative red shingles in the mezzanine level of the restaurant.  

Kaysey’s was owned and operated by Hyman “Kaysey” Kuritch and his wife Esther, who lived in the apartment on the third floor until Esther’s death in 1991. Across from the Shubert Theater, Kaysey\'s was a popular post-show gathering place for audience members and production crew alike, and was a neighborhood institution. In 1968, the Kuritch’s restaurant moved to Chapel Street, where Shake Shack is now located, and stayed there for nearly a decade.

Between 1968 and 1981, 266 College Street contained numerous small and relatively unimportant businesses, interspersed with years of vacancy. The College Spa opened in 1981 and stayed open for 13 years.  In 1995, a restaurant named Casey’s inhabited the space for a few years, undoubtedly a nod to the unforgettable Kaysey’s. 

Between 1999 and 2012, there was a similar period of vacancy and transience to the one following Kaysey’s and it is arguably still in that period, with its past few inhabitants never lasting more than two years. 

Elm City Social’s advertising rhetoric is one of a community gathering spot, and one that’s here to stay. They seem to be trying to evoke the feeling of Kaysey’s minus the theater crowd; we’ll see if they’re the combo breaker.','','[\'Commercial\']','[\'Wood Frame\']','[\'Renaissance Revival\']','[\'Yes, business hours\']','','3','A three-story commercial, mixed-used building from the late nineteenth century, elaborately decorated with terra cotta tiles reminiscent of Spanish Renaissance Revival.

Representing streamlined efficiency, modern technology, achievement and the machine age, Art Deco was the perfect style to represent the ideals of a modern and entrepreneurial laundry company.

Beginning in 1928, George M. Clarke transformed it into a lodging house. From 1941-1959, the building has changed owners various times, offering furnished rooms for people. When A. Bunten owned the building, she was ordered to alter the tenement house by the Building Inspectors. Thus, she improved the exit fire escape facilities by constructing a new balcony on the 2nd floor level in the rear. From 1959 – 1964, the building was left vacant until Angelo Cavaliere occupied the space in 1963. He began to erect a masonry 1-story addition, which included a new steel platform, catwalk, and masonry fence, at the rear of the existing structure.

For the following year, Cavaliere erected a 2-story masonry vestibule addition in the front of the existing structure. Within this vestibule, a new framed stairway was added to the front exits of the second, third and fourth floors. Additionally, he altered the ground floor for his beauty salon, the Angelo’s Salon of Beauty. The remaining floors were occupied by various tenants. During 1970 – 1980, approximately eight tenants lived in the building at the same time. After 1980, the number of tenants had fallen from eight to two. From 1986 - 1987, Farricielli took over and made interior alterations and repairs to the beauty parlor. He also converted the housing into four dwelling units. In 1993, Farricielli opened a Hair and Skin Studio on the ground floor, while two occupants lived on the upper floors. From 2005-2007, America’s Best Promotional, a company that makes advertising promotional products, took over the ground floor business. Variant 13, an alternative clothing store, then briefly occupied the ground floor from 2007 -2008. As of 2015,  Pike International rents the building as multiple one bedroom apartments.','[]','','1872','[\'Crown Street\']','[]','','','277 Crown Street, New Haven, CT','41.306724','','[\'Downtown Chapel Constitutional\']','None');

Booth moved to New Haven in 1819 and was a builder who directed the construction of many dwellings and churches in New Haven and in neighboring Townships.

Wilson Booth died in 1888 and was buried in Grove Street Cemetery.  In his will he left 270 Crown to his daughter Sarah Elizabeth Booth whom at the time was known as Sarah E. Champion. Sarah E. Booth married Henry Champion in 1863 and was widowed in 1867 at the age of 35. In 1896 she authored Our Flag: Its History and Changes from 1620 to 1896, a children’s book which provides illustrations and a history of the evolution of our flag. She published articles in “The Connecticut Magazine: An Illustrated Monthly” and was also a member of the Wooster Chapter of the D.A.R. She died on Mar.11,1917 and left Albert S. Holt as the executor.The home was left to The United Society of New Haven. In 1919, the Katz &amp; Mullen Co. took over the title of the property. The property was leased for one year to the Y.D. Veteran’s Association. In 1922 Dorscht Lodge #2 took over the title of the property. The Dorscht Lodge seems to have been a musical club and it was owned by Louis Felsburg in 1913. The Dorscht club was originally on 139 Orange St. and the members every 1st and 3rd sunday of the year. Louis Felsburg resided at 171 Bradley and worked at Aschenbrodel Verein Inc. at the time. He died in 1925 in which his wife was the executor of the will and the new president was Ferdinand Reichel who gained partial ownership of the property. The owners were all a part of Two Seventy Crown Incorporated and are Ferdinand Reichel, Amelia Reichel, Charles J. Kul, Alfred Calienno, and Adam Hess.

The most notable changes to the original dwelling plan began with the ownership of the Dorscht Lodge Club. These changes can be seen in the Sanborn map of 1924. The structure was extended to the limits of the lot away from crown street. On this same map changes can be seen along the rest of the structures of Crown Street. In 1927, Dorscht Lodge #2 foreclosed to the Citizen’s Bank &amp; Trust Co. In 1930, the Dorscht Club got the title deed once again for 270 Crown Street and it was foreclosed once again in 1937. According to data from 1935, the Dorscht Club no longer met at 270 Crown but instead now met at 301 Crown St.

According to the Dana Collection at the New Haven Historical Society, the Fraternal Order of the Eagles now took residence at 270 Crown St. The Fraternal order of the Eagles is a non-profit organization that “unites frater- nally in the spirit of liberty, truth, justice and equality, to make human life more desirable by lessening its ills” and was originally formed by 6 theater owners. They were competitors who had come together to discuss a musician’s strike. It’s earliest members were usually actors, stagehands and playwrights and they usually met on local theater stages, afterwards they would just socialize and drink beer. According to the 1973 Fire Insurance Map, the FOE club still had met at a portion of 270 Crown St. There is no longer an FOE meeting place in New Haven but there are some in neighboring cities.

Some time shortly after FOE resided at 270 Crown, Haskins Laboratories took residence there. They conduct research of both written and spoken language. They were located at 270 Crown just prior to the temporary relocation of the Yale Art and Architecture Library. Today, the Art and Architecture Library has vacated the space, and it is used by Yale University for other purposes.','[]','','Early 1800\'s','[\'Crown Street\']','[]','','','270 Crown Street, New Haven, CT','41.3061922','','[\'Downtown Chapel Constitutional\']','None');

Trowbridge Jr.’s residence at 284 Crown Street on this corner. The 1911 Atlas shows that the stables in the backyard of on the 1888 Trowbridge plot were demolished before 1911 to become the home the brick residence J. J. Lawton on a new, section-off plot facing High Street. However, the brick structure at the corner of High and Crown remained unchanged until the garage was erected. Directories of the time reveal that the brick building at 284 Crown was the property of Thomas R. Trowbridge, of shipping merchants H. Trowbridge’s Sons, from 1884 to 1889; S. Harrison Wagner, a prominent lawyer, and his family from 1895-1911, and, after his death, his son Harrison G. Wagner in 1912, and his wife Estella C. Wagner in 1913; and the Hebrew Institute from 1914 to 1925.

Turn-of-the-twenieth-century inhabitant of 284 Crown, Simeon Harrison Wagner (1849-1912), was influential in the implementation of electric street railways into many Connecticut towns and cities and in the drafting of state street railway laws. He was also the officer of numerous traction roads in Connecticut and other New England States. To him, the suburbs, with natural beauty and space for thought, should be accessible to all. He believed that the suburbs provided a comfortable and luxurious life for its residents. He hoped to connect the residents of the suburbs to their professional lives in the city center by developing roads and railways. His beliefs were reflected in society’s increasing dependence on the automobile and the residential decentralization of cities. The 1946 Atlas of New Haven shows the Down Town Garage on the southeast corner of Crown and High as one of many motor parks, gas stations and garages in New Haven at the time.

Until its renovation in 2014, the three-story garage was approximately one hundred by seventy six feet. Structurally, the building had a concrete foundation and load-bearing masonry. Vertical supports divided the exterior into bays, three wide and six deep, of varying dimensions, while recessed brick and multi-paned-sash-in-metal-frame windows created horizontal bands. Built in the Art Moderne style, the brick was gold and brown and the masonry parapet has engraved sandstone panels and sandstone coping. On the ground level, several store faced Crown Street and the garage entrance opened onto High. The building was plainly visible from the street and extended to the edge of the lot, bordering the sidewalk. The exterior façade masked the interior function of the building, although the sheering of the horizontal bands of windows on the High Street side references the interior ramp.

In New Haven, the works were in production by 1657 and producing pots by 1663, though the dam necessary for production caused major damage to the environment, highways and fences. Moreover the “non-assimilable” workers introduced to the colony were “turbulent” and “disorderly.” They would remain long after production ceased at the ironworks.

In 1748, the property was purchased by innkeeper made freeman Samuel Cook. As of 1911, it has changed hands to a lady, Ms. Helen Mason of New Haven, who we know made quilts for a local church group called the Silver Aid Society.

The building, designed by local architects Brown and Von Beren, typifies the numerous residential luxurious apartment blocks that were constructed throughout the 1920s. Such buildings marked the changing demographics of cities at the time; they provided spacious accommodations in large building units for the middle classes, where there bad previously only been one or two family dwelling houses available\'. In replacing one and two-family dwelling buildings, like the Trumbull apartments, a forcible intrusion on the scale and density of the neighborhood occurred.

The building itself is a 35 unit, five-story, brick and concrete structure, in a U-shaped plan, that is seven bays wide along Trumbull Street and six bays deep along Orange Street. The building measures 113 feet on Trumbull Street, 83.9 feet on Orange Street, 84.8 feet on its Western face, and 11 3.3 feet on its North face. "The flat roof is edged by a stone or concrete bracketed cornice and brick parapet with stone coping. The Trumbull Street facade is composed of symmetrical projecting 2 bay wide pavilions with a 3-bay recessed center portion, in which the first-floor entry is located\'\'\'. From the exterior it can be observed that the basement and first floor walls are of "rusticated cast stone masonry with double 6xl sash windows under rusticated flat arches· ... Upon entering the building one notices the lobby for its ornate glass entry doors, marble paneling and stairs as well as the detailed tile floors. Despite having numerous owners since its completion in 1920, there have been no major renovations to either the exterior or interior of the building. Originally owned by Adolph Perlroth\', the building was sold to the Maplewood Realty Company in 1948. In 1950 the building transferred ownership to Lawrence and Allan Loeb\'s Trumbull Holding Corporation who converted two of the first floor apartments into one professional office and one doctor\'s offices. In 1954 two additional first apartments were converted into professional offices". The property was acquired by Allen Hadelman, of Hadley Inc, in 1981 and remains his today. When purchased by Mr. Hadelman "nothing was up to code" but since then it has been brought up to standard with the instillation of a safe and working elevator and a proper boiler.','[]','','1919-1920','[\'Whitney-Audubon\']','[]','Brown and Von Beren','','37-39 Trumbull Street, New Haven, CT','41.3122621','','[\'The Whitney Avenue Walk\']','None');

Merwin House at 406 Orange Street and his son’s house at 412 Orange Street.  While later owners (logically) used the two spaces as garages for automobiles, their most recent occupants converted the structure in the 1970s into a mixed-use building, housing a single-family residence in one half and the office of Pozzi Associates Architects in the other half.

Luckily for preservationists, the various owners of the carriage house have preserved its key architectural features.  Chief among these is its symmetry, which is still readily apparent from the front façade, despite some significant changes to both sides (the two sets of carriage doors on the residence side have been replaced with a modern garage door and a recessed entrance door set in by a curved wall; on the office side, one set of carriage doors has also been set in to create an awning over the entrance).  The retention of the original carriage doors and windows on the office side of the front façade allows one to easily envision how the building appeared in the late nineteenth century, when horse-drawn carriages were still stored on the first floor and hay was still hoisted up to the storage loft through the second-floor windows.  Save the pair of circular windows in the gable, all other windows share a segmental arch shape with stone sills and radiating voussiors.  The roof-line is ornamented by corbelled brick work.  Whitewashed brick on the left and right sides of the building are the sole reminders of the horse stables that once stood there.  The symmetry continues in the back façade, although the wooden addition attached to the back of the residence side, complete with a mezzanine and a row of skylights, somewhat disrupts the original aesthetic harmony (despite the owner’s choice of a non-obtrusive dark green color).

This symmetry is a notable departure from the design from the 1854 Merwin house at 406 Orange Street, a side-entrance grey clapboard house boasting both Greek Revival and Italianate features.  412 Orange Street, a large Italian Villa-style home dating to 1868, only shares its symmetry and brick façade with the carriage house.  Unsurprisingly, both houses boast far grander and more elaborate features than the carriage house, reflecting the latter’s original identity as an outbuilding.  The location of the building—at the rear edge of the two Orange Street properties, on a dead-end block of Lincoln Street—further reminds us of its former use.  Interestingly, neither the carriage house nor the block itself is represented on an O.H. Bailey &amp; J.C. Hazen 1879 map of New Haven, although both appear on a G.M. Hopkins 1888 map of the same area.  This perhaps suggests that the block was not formerly built until the construction of the carriage house.  Regardless, the block’s use as a busy urban pathway today is more attributable to the construction of the Lincoln Street Theatre at its terminus and the creation of a pedestrian pathway linking the street to Audobon Street.

Although the use of the structure has changed, its original purpose could also be considered “mixed-use.”  On each side, the first floor housed horse-drawn carriages, while the upper level boasted a loft space for hay storage.  The unfinished basement of the office side served as a small workshop, which was accessible through a backdoor.  It is unclear what was produced there, or whether the other side’s basement also served as a workshop.  According to an architect at Pozzi Associates, this basement originally served as part of the Underground Railroad, as a tunnel running through the basement formerly linked the harbor to the railroad cut by the Farmington Canal, which ran up to Northampton, Massachusetts.

While the carriage house’s contemporary uses are perhaps less noble than aiding emancipation, the physical adaptation of the space to accommodate these uses are inventive.  The conversion of one half of the structure into a single-family residence in 1973 is particularly imaginative.  Designed by its owner, architect Frank Winder, the entire interior was outfitted in teak wood in order to feel like the cabin of a ship—a reflection of Winder’s passion for boating.[i]  The first floor now houses a garage, a dining room, and a kitchen, while the loft is used as a living room and open space and the mezzanine as a bedroom.  While the changes to the interior are indeed sweeping, Winder seems to have made an effort to minimize the visual impact of changes to the exterior, choosing relatively inconspicuous colors and confining alterations to former carriage door spaces.  Pozzi’s conversion of the other half of the structure in 1976 paid decidedly more attention to preservation, conserving the original carriage doors and windows and altering the interior only as necessary to accommodate office use.  Original exposed-brick walls and wooden ceilings remain in the interior.  The loft is currently used as studio space, while the now-finished basement is used for storage.  Accordingly, the New Haven Preservation Trust has presented both owners with a Merit Award for their restoration and maintenance of the property.

What is most striking about the Merwin-Osborne Carriage House’s transition from an outbuilding to a primary component of the built environment is its timing.  Its conversion predated the creation of the neighboring Audobon arts district, which today boasts numerous mixed-use spaces and several architecture studios.  More impressive yet, this conversion occurred in the midst of Urban Renewal, a movement decidedly averse to density and mixed-use development; the now-ubiquitous conversions of former outbuildings or industrial facilities for “loft-living” or office use would not be in vogue for another two to three decades.  Today, the building’s seamless integration into the surrounding urban streetscape affirms the foresight and ingenuity of its re-designers.

While the preservation efforts of its current owners are certainly praiseworthy, it is the ‘imperfections’ currently found on the façade that are perhaps the most telling.  The graffiti art painted on the sides of the building reflects the changing demographics and usage of the surrounding neighborhood.  Unlike the sporadic and forgettable “tags” on the front of the building, the spray-painted images on the side of building, which includes a colorful depiction of the earth, come across more as public art than vandalism.  Its very presence reflects the transition of the neighborhood from a wealthy residential enclave to a more urbanized and socioeconomically-diverse district.  Within close proximity to the former carriage house are several public high schools and after-school arts programs; the resulting user population for the neigborhood is largely comprised of public school students, whose diversity reflects the diversity of New Haven as a whole.  At the same time, the area remains home to numerous professional offices, namely lawyers’ and doctors’ offices, as well as several architecture galleries and art studios.  This dense and eclectic mix of users and uses is typical of an urban neighborhood, and a considerable departure from the neighborhood’s former character.  Since public art, particularly graffiti art and murals, is a distinctly urban phenomenon, its presence on the walls of the carriage house reinforces this modern urban identity, while its presence on this particular historic building unites the old Lincoln Street with the new.

[i] City records indicate that the former owners, Planned Parenthood Inc. (which, by the 1960s, occupied one of the Orange Street houses) initially obtained a permit for conversion of the carriage house into a residence in 1962; however, Winder did not obtain a permit for such a conversion until 1973.  According to Winder’s wife, who still resides at 3 Lincoln Street, she and her husband moved into the space in the late 1960s.','[]','','1880\'s','[]','[]','','','3-9 Lincoln Street, New Haven, CT','41.31209','','[\'The Whitney Avenue Walk\']','None');

Soon after the was built, foundries, oil burning plants, and manufacturing sprung up on the area. The land fronting Whitney across from Howard Street was at least partially owned by the New Haven Manufacturing Company, opposite. At least some of the land was also owned by Cornelius Scranton Bushnell, an entrepreneur and engineer who came to New Haven at age 15, and by age 20, in 1848, began investing in New Haven properties. By 1858, he was working on the New York New Haven Railroad. Bushnell is most famous as a Civil War hero, known for his work on the US Navy\'s battleship Monitor. After the war, Bushnell continued to acquire land north of the McLagon Foundry (in 1866 New Haven\'s leading foundry), excepting a small holdout, still owned by the New Haven Manufacturing Company. Bushnell died in 1896, but his estate remained intact, under the name of his first wife: the Emily Bushnell Estate. During this time, the New Haven Manufacturing Company was developing its small plot of land across from the major factory with mainly wooden buildings. However, by 1888, the company, which machined tools such as planers,lathes, and other medium-weight equipment, had constructed its first masonry building on Whitney\'s west side. Surrounded by the Bushnell estate, this building was two stories, with a third level-attic type space under the eves. The window layout and hints at the original wall structure suggest that the first floor was divided space for offices, administration, etc, while the second story was open manufacturing floor. The New Haven Manufacturing Company owned the space until 1923, when the Timkin-Detroit Oil Burning Company moved in. Timkin \' s briefstint gave rise to the trend which has occupied the building until today- short to medium term occupation by small business, office, and retail.

By 1925, this building was known as 52 Whitney, and Timkin was sharing its space with the Bradly Plumbing Company. By 1931 , the nearby Buckley Scott Oil Burners (at 56) must have driven Timkin away. The building was now occupied by the Chamberlain metal Weather Strip Co, Hoyt Grand Power Plant Equipment, and the CT committee on Public Service information. During the 30\'s, the building fell into a pattern that would maintain it for the rest of the century: storefront retail, first floor; small businesses, second floor, and more offices or residential apartments, third floor. Over the years, the lower levels contained: Bostwick Antiques; Smerling Light Manufacturing; Benjamin Beck, Druggist; Hahn Engineers, engineering equipment retail, and myriad real estate, accounting, and law offices. By the 40\'s, the building had adopted its current 53-54-56 numbering, and, though its business levels stood vacant, intermittently, the upper levels were adapted, making them more comfortable for residential purposes. (The dormers and windows on the third floor were added sometime between the late 30\'s and the 50\'s) In addition to Hoyt-Grant Power Plant suppliers in the 40\'s, long term occupants include Kirby Accounting, Krevit Real Estate, Resnick and Driscoll Lawyers in the 50\'s and 60\'s, Bruce Music Company and Pianos as well as Reliance Typewriter in the 70\'s, and, by 1978, we saw the arrival of our first currant occupant: Bryn Mawr Books, stuffed back into the building\'s small alleyway appendage. Dunkin Donuts moved into the space in the late 80\' s, replacing Olympic Typewriter, and at the turn of the century,  Kanevsky Art replaces Anthony\'s Hair excellence. Bryn Mawr and Dunkin Donuts are still in Business, while the Kanevsky space is currently unused. No residential has occupied the upper floors for several decades. Due to the "mundane" nature of this building, I expect people had little reason to photograph it-I have not turned up many pictures. However, one, taken in the early 30\' s, showed the Chamberlain Metal Weather Strip Company, with familiar parallel parking in front of it. The building\'s facade was almost identical to the current incarnation, with the exception of the additional upper story dormers. The original brickwork appears to remain, and while the woodwork must surely have been replaced several times since the building\'s inception it seems to have remained almost identical in execution. The building was originally constructed in a spare, utilitarian, though not unattractive style, and because of this-square open floor plans with little ornament- we have been able to see such constant, varied occupation with little change to the original structure.','[]','','','[\'Whitney-Audubon\']','[]','','','54 Whitney Avenue, New Haven, CT','41.3120796','','[\'The Whitney Avenue Walk\']','None');

The building\' s principal entrance lies on the corner, but an entrance to a second commercial space also lies on Grove Street, and a residential entrance opens to Orange Street. The building, a brick and wood construction, has been referred to by both its Orange Street address and its Grove Street address, but the address 41 Grove seems to have taken preeminence in most official documents.

The Immediate Neighborhood

A map from 1748 shows the area as being relatively sparsely developed. Though Orange Street led to Mill River, a source of economic life for the city, the street itself did not have a commercial feel to it- occupational records show mostly farmers, with some weavers and priests occupying the small lots along Whitney, Grove, and Orange Streets. This development pattern continues in neighborhood maps from 1824. Not until an 1851 map does major change occur, with the New Haven &amp; North Hampton Railroad Line being redirected to cut through the plot. Following this, the area seems to have been developed more completely. The neighborhood begins to see a growth in the number of factories during the late 1880s, as well, and a carriage factory, folding chair factory, and foundry are all present by 1888. The presence of these factories most likely attracted a new type of residential, and in 1911 the neighborhood seems to have taken on a more working class immigrant population. Based on the types of religious institutions and names evident in earlier documents, the area seems to have housed a generally white, native, protestant population. Beginning in 1911, however, maps show the presence of a German Lutheran Church, and the Mishkan Israel Congregation. Finally, by 1923, the neighborhood seems to have taken on a distinctly Jewish and Italian/Catholic character. Most of the names of property owners from this time are ethnically Jewish or Italian, and one sees a dramatic rise in Catholic institutions, including St. Mary\'s Academy, St. Mary\'s Church, and the Catholic Community House.

History

The current building on 336-8 Orange Street was built by Lewis Fitch in 1868. Fitch was most likely a clerk in his relative\' s clothing store, since records show that a clothing business run by Horace Fitch existed at the time on 225 Chapel Street. The original mortgage for the lot was $2,200, and the family seems to have had a certain financial means - at least two other properties are attributed to the Fitches in the Orange Street neighborhood during the late 19\'" century, one of which lay on Grove and Chapel. In 1900, after 32 years in the house, Lewis Fitch\'s daughter sold the property. The first records of commercial use for the building date from the Dieter Bros. grocery store, which is listed in the New Haven phone book from 1905 until 1913, and it seems likely that the building has been used for commercial purposes since then. Currently, the ground floor houses "Salon Glitter", a hair and beauty salon that caters mostly to a black customer base. The current plot of land defines the strange shape of its neighbor. The property of 41 Grove, is shown as a relatively square plot alone in city records until 1921, when a triangular piece of land (45 Grove) first appears as an attachment to the original property. The parcel may have been owned in the original plot of land but not developed due to its unattractive location and positioning; the parcel faces the former canal site and the back of 340 Orange street, meaning it had no access to the street. Any sort of light or ventilation access would also have necessitated opening windows towards the railroad tracks, which may have further discouraged residential development. Currently the building that covers the site appears to be used as a storage space for Sitar, the restaurant that occupies 45 Grove Street.

In addition, Sanborn Maps from 1923 indicate a uniform build out along Orange Street. Most likely, it was at this time that the building gained the addition facing Orange Street, that now houses an extension to the commercial side of the building, and additional residential space. When one enters "Salon Glitter" this division is made apparent - the side of the store that faces Orange Street is used for men\'s haircuts, and is divided from the women\'s side of the store by a party wall. The addition also fundamentally changed the orientation of the store - the new entrance, instead of facing Grove Street, faces the intersection of Grove and Orange. Based on this decision, and newspaper accounts of vehicular traffic from the early 1900s to the 1930s, it seems likely that the intersection was a busy one.

In 1972 the property immediately surrounding the building was the subject of a buyout from the City of New Haven. This was done by the State Street Redevelopment and Renewal Project, and involved the sale of property owned by Sylvia and Claire Blumefeld, Dionigi Russo and the Penn Central Transportation Co. Most likely, this property acquisition was part of the effort on the behalf of the city to develop the large parking lot that currently exists on Grove Street. The effort was probably an attempt to attract suburban commuters, and perhaps shoppers, to the depopulating city. Finally, the building appears to have undergone a cheap renovation since 1983, when the Historic Resources Inventory evaluated 41 Grove Street. This renovation have changed the size and number of windows on the upper two floors, and removed the third story bay window. Based on the quality of these changes, the landlord was hesitant to invest significant funds into the property.

Bullard','[\'Commercial\']','[]','[]','[]','','','The Bullard Building, located on the comer of Elm and Orange Streets sits on a parcel originally owned by Theophilus Eaton, a mercantilist Puritan, who as the first governor of New Haven (1639) sought to quickly develop the colony. Later, in the second half of the eighteenth century, Eli Whitney after opening a gun factory in 1798 purchased what had been formerly Eaton\'s land and built a second "city" family home. Will records show that the parcel remained in the Whitney family. passing from son to son until the 19205, when after the last Eli Whitney passed away, the block was sold to H.M Bullard. In 1926 construction began on the Bullard building, and at a cost of 340,000$, by 1927 the building was completed.

Today, as in 1927, the building is five stories tall and despite the parallel high towers, it maintains a sizable stature. The Bullard family began their furniture business in 1898 and were originally located on Orange, near Center street. The erection of the building for the purposes of the Bullard business expansion was both an expression and reinforcement of a then growing capitalist New Haven. This new commercial market was a fast and powerful outgrowth of a national post-War manufacturing boom. That railroads, power plants and large-scale companies, like Winchester, came to New Haven was significant to the city\'s urban development and commercial successes. Additionally, the boom readjusted New Haven\'s physical scale. Newly automobile trafficked streets likened spaces never before connected and congested~ in this new down town~ to which the Bullard building was central, became a place of convergence, a milieu of floor and street life against which the speeding and meandering cars and people exchanged and intersected.

In the new building, Bullards occupied the entire ground floor as a showroom, and now employing close to 75 people, used the second floor as an office. On the top three floors The New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad ran its central passenger traffic and accounting department offices. Their presence in the downtown building indicated the company\'s growth as well as a new structural relevance of railroads in the urban landscape. Now, a railroad network was coalescing in a unified system within New Haven. Later, in the 1950s, the Railroad moved its offices to Meadow Street. In its place, the Fann Bureau Insurance Company, Price and Lee (a company which published New Haven phone books) the offices of the US District Attorney, Richard Blumenthal, as well as the national jewelry distribution firm, Irving Michaels and Company moved in. While the building maintained its commercial furniture business, the depression after the former industrialism shifted the buildings\' heart. Housing the offices of the Attorney General rooted the building in some of the political, social challenges of the time.

During the Korean War, the armed forces and induction center- where Connecticut residents were "processed" for the army-was located on the fourth floor. Later, Community Progress Inc, an organization dedicated to poverty relief, had its headquarters in the building. And many times, the New Haven Register reported, the police were called to handle conflicts. And while the commercial-retail success of the twenties, which saw Kramer\'s and Bullard \'s in fierce competition had slowed, the area was now becoming an office business district. Across from Bullards on Elm Street, the Union Trust Company opened its headquarters. The Southern New England Telephone Company (SNET) also moved to the area. Mayor Richard C. Lee, following his election in 1953, further encouraged this development. While office tenants changed throughout the years, Bullards continued to monopolize the ground floor with its furniture showroom. In 1968 the company merged with Alderman Furniture Company and WB Hall. While Bullards retained its name, Myles H Alderman became president. In 1977, he spent $ 100,000 on store renovations. This renovation, the New Haven Register reported, came" as a part of a downtown revitalization". The new Mayor, Frank Logue commented on the renovation saying, it "shows confidence in the development of our downtown as a regional commercial center." However, this was dubious. The period was marked by a shift in the commercial market, from the downtown center to the suburban periphery. Thus, following this trend, soon after the renovation, Bullard\'s keyed into the promising opportunities of the suburb and moved out to Branford where they were able to successfully catch the outer-city, driving, middle-class clientele of Hamden, Branford, and North Haven. However, while the area would not be a commercial success, developers were coming to see downtown\'s capacity to successfully house offices.

Cambridge Associates bought the Bullard building and planned for massive renovations. Chester Zaniewski, general partner of the firm invested close to 6 million dollars in the space, planning building revitalized which would "both complement the traditional architectural style and afford views of the green". He hired Roth and Moore Architects, a New Haven based firm to refurbish the "traditional commercial stucture". They restored the brick, added herringbone details and two-story arch windows on the fourth and fifth floors. Additionally, they created a cellar-arched lobby with a small adjacent space for a ground floor retail, office or shop. Interestingly, Harold Roth, the architect of the redevelopment, described in our interview, that the peculiar arched bay windows on the fourth and fifth levels were in fact a result of a long legal battle. Michaels Jewelers, who had occupied the building for twenty years or so, had had a very stiff lease contract with Myles Aldennan before the building was sold. The lease would not come up for five years after the building\'s development. It stated something along the lines of "no adjustments of any kind could be made, only certain people could enter their offices". Roth said they were unmovable in their contract. Roth also suggested that it seemed as if Michaels Jewelers were covering up some criminal activity in their offices, their steadfast, secret behavior was perhaps an effort to maintain their businesses legitimacy. However, Zaniewski wanted to move on with the development, so Roth and Moore worked on every floor except for the fourth and fifth , and instead, on those floors, built a new facade literally over the old one. Legally, therefore, they were not entering or adjusting Michaels\'s leased space. For marketing and aesthetic appeal, they built an extra layer of windows, doubling those on the fourth and fifth floors.

Five years later, when the jewelers moved out, they simply removed the inner layer of windowpanes and made the few interior amendments. Harold Roth also related that the client had developed the building in effort to reap profits from the again burgeoning downtown. The building, he assessed, was "quite funky" before its reconstruction. And Zaniewski and his partners, mid construction commented, " I think that when this is done, we will give a new definition to class A in New Haven". Features of the "class A" extended beyond the refurbished exterior architecture, the new building, completed in 1981, opened with a two doormen lobby, open 10ft-like office spaces and views of the green. It was "compatible" with its neighbors- the Union Trust Building, The New Haven Savings Bank and the SNET headquarters. Another developer summed up the block saying, "we consider this building to be in one of the finest blocks in town." Today the building still operates essentially as an office rental space. Everything from a yoga studio to a real estate company are tenants. The ground floor is mostly a lobby with an adjacent coffee shop. Java Coffee. Roth said that he thought this was formerly some kind of a small insurance brokerage firm, and that Java Coffee had moved in about eight years ago. The shop is only open during the weekdays. and for early hours,

The cafe\'s pretty clean interior, hours and quick-stop feel indicates its clients are probably largely office workers in the nearby buildings. In this sense. today the geography of the Bullard Building describes an absent pedestrian, commercial  downtown; rather it is a surging office district. The changes and developments, which began in the eighties, seem to have been successful-- the building it still well maintained, its floors are filled with businesses, Thus through the transformation of the Bullard building from 1927 through today. we can trace social. physical and economic changes of New Haven \'s downtown.','[]','','1926','[\'Downtown\']','[]','','','57 Elm Street, New Haven, CT','41.27931419999999','','[\'The Whitney Avenue Walk\']','None');

The huge rectangles in the concrete façade that once housed leaded casement windows are now either boarded up with plywood or filled in with concrete blocks. The difference in material suggests that the process of removing the factory’s windows was completed in stages. Interestingly, the fenestration in the now-solid areas of the façade gives a more fine-tuned record of the factory’s progressive conversion from its original form to the current state. The different shapes, sizes, and locations of the windows scattered on the exterior of the building trace a time-line for the building’s renovation, revealing the different instances when the owners saw fit to block up a large section of the façade (see fig 1). Now housing an auto-repair shop, the building’s plain façade belies this site’s important role in New Haven’s industrial base.

This site is very important to New Haven’s industrial history precisely because of its location. Originally bounded by railroad tracks on the west, the Winchester Arms factory on the north, Winchester Avenue on the East, and private homes on the south, the site embodies the reasons industrial production came to the city and flourished in the second half of the 19th century: easy access to railroads, workers, and jobs. Records at the Yale University Manuscripts and Archives contain legal documents pertaining to the site’s history from 1874. These records date from just 27 years after the Farmington Canal, the western border of the site, was converted from a canal to a railway for the New York, New Haven, and Hartford Railroad Company. This rail route brought industrial materials both to this site and to the Winchester Arms factory, which allowed this area to develop many industrial factories and warehouses. Because of the railroad access, the first warehouse was constructed on the site between 1874 and 1879 for a meat-packing firm, the Judson Packing Company, which was a division of the nationalized United States Casualty Co (see figure 2).

As seen in figure 2, the areas surrounding the site were still mainly residential around the turn of the 20th century. The first twenty years of the 20th century would see enormous industrial growth and increased residential concentration in New Haven; much of this growth was centered on the Winchester Arms factory, just north of this site, making it an important beneficiary of the industrial and residential growth in the neighborhood. In 1906, Frank P Pfleghar bought the site at 182 Winchester and constructed a warehouse for his specialty hardware manufacturing business. By 1911, the factory was surrounded by other industrial warehouses, including CB Curtis, Celuloid Starch Co., and Hygienic Ice Co. (see figure 4). In order for the factories to function, the companies needed workers; thus the huge difference between the 1888 and 1911 Sanborn insurance maps is not only the increased concentration of industrial buildings, but also the great proliferation of residential units (compare figures 3 and 4). In the early 20th century, in addition to the people who could walk to work, the factories around 182 Winchester enticed workers from all parts of the city who could access the factories on the streetcars that ran on tracks going up Winchester Ave (see figure 4). The site was not only a local center of industry but one that attracted people from all over the city.

Just as the site’s history parallels New Haven’s industrial ascendance, so too does it correspond to New Haven’s decline in industrial productivity. After the advent of electric power, factories no longer had to be concentrated in the cities where it was cheapest to transport coal. Thus starting in the 1920s, New Haven’s industries began to leave for cheaper land outside the city. The Great Depression compounded this problem for New Haven’s industrial base, causing the foreclosure of numerous mortgages, including that of 182 Winchester, and forced the consolidation of the companies that remained afloat. The building constructed by Pfleghar for his hardware company changed hands numerous times in the 1920s and 30s before being bought by McKesson &amp; Robbins Co, a drug and liquor wholesaler. It is unclear whether or not the proprietors of McKesson &amp; Robbins Co. tore down the Pfleghar building (as the Connecticut Historical Report purports) or modified it, because elements of the building on the site seen in the 1911 and the 1940s Sanborn maps seem very similar (see figures 4 and 5). The date of construction of the McKesson &amp; Robbins building is an important discussion because the economic conditions of New Haven were very different in 1911 than in 1935; if constructed in 1911, the building would reflect the burgeoning industrial base in New Haven while if it were constructed in 1935, it would represent the company’s misplaced desire to create a new building in the midst of an economic crisis rather than modify an existing structure to the company’s needs.

By 1941, much of New Haven’s industrial base was already consolidated and the demand for subsidized housing was increasing as people lost their jobs as a result of firms leaving the city. Starting in the 1950s and continuing through the 1970s, New Haven’s city leadership promoted a process of urban renewal that included the construction of the Elm Haven Extension apartments across Canal Street (formerly the railroad tracks) from 182 Winchester. This development wiped out a huge swath of land formerly dedicated to singly- and two-family homes, replacing it with an expansive public housing block, and forever changing the composition of the neighborhood.

Even today, the site parallels the status of New Haven’s economic situation. The current building at 182 Winchester has been reconfigured to house an auto-repair shop. The Winchester factory is almost completely closed down, but the Elm Haven apartments have been replaced with new, mixed-income houses. The New Haven of today is a city urban infill (through projects like Elm Haven or through reusing existing structures for new purposes) and of juxtaposing the derelict with the chic (such as the juxtaposition of Science Park at Yale with the abandoned Winchester factory). Because of its intimate connection with the New Haven infrastructure, the building at 182 Winchester is and always has been highly representative of the economic and social condition of New Haven.','[]','','','[\'Winchester\']','[]','','','182 Winchester Street, New Haven, CT','41.319405','','[\'Industry & Luxury around Prospect Hill\']','None');

Connecticut Historical Commission Report). Today it is known as Tudor Terrace and includes subsequent dwelling units down the slope in the back of the house. with a parking lot in the center of the layout. Facing east. it covers 85\' x 50\'on the original site. It is two and a half stories, built in a Tudor Revival style designed by Grosvenor Atterbury. and constructed by Larkin-Carey Co(New Haven Historical Society. Connecticut Historical Commission Report). At the time of construction the house cost just a little over $3.000; today the replacement cost is nearly a million dollars ($986.434) The exterior of the house as we see it today consists of a load bearing brick facade with double end chimneys and gable tile root. The window of the left octagonal entrance consists of art deco pattern and leaded gloss panels(New Haven Historical Society. Connecticut Historical Commission Report). The total finished area of the structure today is 5.873 square feet with 8 bathroom, 8 bedrooms, and a total 20 rooms.

However, the interior is vastly different than the layout that existed previously. Originally a single family home. the servant\'s quarter was changed into a bathroom for $376.00 in 1941 (New Haven Historical Society Plans and Permit Office). It wasn\'t until 1959, however, that the building was changed from a one family dwelling to an eight family dwelling with three suites on each of the first floor and second floors and two apartments on the third floor (New Haven Historical Society and Permit Office). When the structure was converted it was owned by the Gorham Realty Co (New Haven Permit Office). The fact that it was converted in the late 1950\'s is significant because in New Haven this was a time of great transition and re-development. Many blocks of homes were being razed in order to enhance city living as people moved to the suburbs. As these blocks of homes were being redeveloped many displaced people tried to move within the city and existing structures needed to be re-used and changed to accommodate housing needs (New Haven. Reshaping the City 1900-1980). The house was built for a Yale English professor and Athletic Director. George H. Nettleton (New Haven Historical Society. Dana Articles).

Both Nettleton and Grosvenor Atterbury studied at Yale and had a strong affiliation with the University. As an architect, Atterbury was known for his early work building weekend houses for wealthy industrialists. In 1909 he created a system for prefabricated homes which he implemented in his Forest Hills Gardens Housing development (Wikipedia). The house at 570 Prospect was featured in a 1921 article which described the workmanship and material quality of the dwelling along with the manicured garden that added to the quaintness of the structure. The bricks laid for wide raked joints were designed at the request of Nettleton who had traveled Europe and desired walls of bolder texture (New Haven Historical Society, Dana Articles). From this we know the house started as a well to-do living structure, located far from the city center. Designed by a well known architect, using expensive materials, located along the trolley car line, the house, complete with servants quarters, became the home of a very active, involved and worldly Yale professor who in his position as Athletic Director helped with development of the Payne Whitney Gymnasium (YDN). Over time many other structures began popping up along the street changing the dynamics of the neighborhood. Even before the conversion to a multi-family dwelling, Mr. Nettleton starting renting out a portion of his house to another Yale Professor in 1930 based on telephone book listings; then he rented to 3 people in 1959 (New Haven Historical Society, Telephone Directory). Eventually such changes occurred throughout the entire neighborhood which has resulted in the enchantment and excitement we find along Prospect today.','[]','','1910-1911','[\'Prospect Hill\']','[]','Grosvenor Atterbury','','570 Prospect Street, New Haven, CT','41.32740039999999','','[\'Industry & Luxury around Prospect Hill\']','None');

Standing at three stories tall with twenty-four units, six units at each address corresponding to the doors in the main courtyard, [3] the condominiums provide luxury alternatives to housing in the neighborhood. Across the street from the super block of apartments built in the 1950s,[4] the condominiums are one of the housing options open to residents of the neighborhood. With its “gable roof pavilions [that] accent ends of complex…modillion cornice and frieze line at broad eaves,”[5] and its community evoking courtyard,[6] the condominiums are desirable for individuals and families wishing to remain in the Prospect Hill neighborhood in apartment units but not wanting to live in the repetitious 1950s apartments.

Prospect Garden Condominiums was known as Highland-Prospect Apartment House when initially constructed in 1926.[7] Prior to the construction of the apartment complex, the Prospect Hill neighborhood was not densely populated. The housing in the neighborhood consisted entirely of large single-family residences, with large tracts of lands undeveloped.[8] The Prospect Hill neighborhood was a predominately middle class, upper-middle class area. The apartment complex provided the densest housing in the neighborhood with sixteen units and was “an approach to multiple housing in an established neighborhood.”[9] It provided cheaper, smaller units for families wishing to find different alternatives to the large single-family house prevalent at the time. These units were not merely dense housing; these were luxury, high end units as the “dormer story was originally servants quarters for each unit.” [10] By the 1970s, the neighborhood fabric had completely changed with the construction of the massive 1950s apartment complex across the street, and the infill of empty lots with smaller single-family houses.[11] Despite the many years that have past, the complex’s exterior looks amazingly similar to how it looked when originally constructed,[12] the only difference being the erection of a parking lot in the front of the complex some time after the photo was taken.

Throughout its lifetime, the apartment complex has been residence to many upper middle class and middle class individuals and families. There were generally two themes to the tenants of the apartment building. The first theme consisted of white-collar professionals, who were often unmarried, although, sometimes married and with children. These professionals included physicians who worked at Yale New Haven Hospital, Yale University professors, managers, salesmen, presidents or vice presidents of local businesses, utility related officials including the president of the New Haven Gas Light company, and finance sector related officials.[13] These families and individuals most likely wanted to live in the Prospect Hill neighborhood because of its high-end reputation, and lacked the means to pay for a house in the neighborhood. The second kind of tenants that lived in the apartments consisted of widows and widowers. These individuals either came to complex from the area already having been widowed or had been widowed while living in the apartment. Because of the cheaper living and smaller quarters, it was much easier to live in the units than it was to live in a large single family home. A notable tenant in 1960, Mary Nettleton, wife of George Nettleton, had lived the majority of her life two lots from the complex, until her husband passed away in 1959.[14]

The Prospect Garden Condominiums continue to be an integral part of the current neighborhood fabric. Its historical characteristics and style continue to affect the neighborhood, and consequently, the building was nominated in the late 1970s to be part of the Prospect Hill Neighborhood Historical District.[15]  While the exterior of the complex has remained relatively unchanged, the interior of the building has been modified on several occasions; the most notable of the renovations were the renovations in the late 1970s. Responding to increased demand for units in the complex and different social environment, the dormer story, formerly servant’s quarters, was renovated into additional units, increasing the sixteen-unit apartment complex to a twenty-four-unit apartment complex.[16] The complex continues to successfully adapt to the changing neighborhood environment and to be one of the more remarkable buildings in the area.

Seeming impressively daunting and somewhat secluded, the Masonic Temple sits facing the Yale University science complex with four “massive, fluted Ionic columns” framing the uninviting bronze double doors that mark the entrance to the grand building.[1] Located on slightly over half an acre, the New Haven Masonic Temple was created in 1926 and is a Colonial Revival style building made of cast stone with a load bearing masonry and structural iron or steel frame.[2] It has a flat roof and consists of four stories and a basement. The Temple was built by Norton and Townsend, and at the time of construction was estimated to cost about $300,000.[3] It was classified as a “Fireproof fraternal building” and provided housing and offices for a private society.[4] A wide cornice stands out between the second and third floors, and when looked at closely is decorated with lion heads, perhaps symbolizing the secretive fraternal nature of the building.[5]

From the outside, one can see the words “Masonic Temple” carved in block letters directly below a broken arch.[6] A staircase leads to a pair of large, dark doors with decorative fish scale grillwork above, which portrays the somewhat secretive and eerie character of the building.[7] The doors open up however, to a vestibule with marble floor and what one may imagine as a grand staircase leading up to the next floor.[8] As one enters, a committee room is located on the right with rubber tile floor while a library is off to the left. The library floor is made of rubber tile with a marble base, and also houses a fireplace with a tile hearth on the wall closest to Whitney Avenue.[9] The building is roughly 140’ by 80’ and with the land included, is valued at slightly under one million dollars.[10]

285 Whitney has not always been home to the New Haven Masonic Association however. A Sanborn map from 1888 shows a property set slightly back from Whitney Avenue with a curving driveway, existing between Humphrey and Bishop Street. [11] It appears however, that this home did not occupy the address of 285 Whitney. The land must have been divided up and sold sometime between 1888 and 1911 therefore, as Cassius W. Kelly’s Sanborn map from 1911 does indicate a home on the property now owned by the Masonic Association.[12] 285 Whitney’s previous owner was that of Professor E. Hersey Sneath – a Yale University Philosophy professor.[13] Senath’s house was built by Mr. Todd from Carrer and Hastings and had an early French architectural design. Many trees surrounded it, and large turrets stood atop its roof.[14] Sneath worked at Yale from 1889-1923, but only owned the property from 1906-1925. His wife, Anna C. Sneath, sold the property in 1925 – two years after Professor Sneath suffered a heart attack and died from falling down the stairs in his home. She sold the property on July 28th to the Masonic Temple Association of New Haven who received a building permit on March 12, 1926 and began creating what exists there today.[15]

There have been few recorded changes to the Masonic Temple since 1926, however the lack of documentation is not to say that changes did not actually occur. From 1926-2008 however, two building permits were issued, and two changes have occurred, both in 2000. The first modification was a chair lift installation from the entry landing to the first floor in order to make the building handicap accessible. This change was estimated at around $1000 to implement. The other change that took place was the demolition of Professor Sneath’s garage. The garage had been used as a two-car garage and was made of brick walls and a wooden roof. Frank Chapman, who claimed no historic significance of the building, filed for the permit for the demolition on behalf of the New Haven Masonic Temple Association, and on February 2, it was destroyed. Professor Sneath’s garage can clearly be seen in both the Sanborn map of 1911 as well as the engineering layout of the property in the back right hand corner of the property line.[16] This demolition broke the last tie that held the two owners of 285 Whitney Avenue together.

Walker','[\'Residential\']','[]','[]','[]','','','255 Whitney, Sachem Apartments, is a dignified colonial revival building on the corner on Whitney Avenue and Humphrey Street.  It is five stories tall with a façade of brick and cast stone. Sachem Apartments was built circa 1920,[1] probably around 1925 judging from the land records, which show that by 1925 all parcels of land that now comprise the property were consolidated under the ownership of Charles P. Walker.[2]  Built after many of the other prominent buildings along the block, Sachem Apartments exhibits a style that is meant to harmonize with its neighbors including the adjacent colonial revival apartment, 245 Whitney.

The building has always been rental apartments – one and two bedrooms and studios – housing mainly individuals or couples associated with Yale University.[3] Its prime location near the quiet, picturesque East Rock neighborhood within easy walking distance of New Haven’s business district and Yale University’s science hill, make it particularly appealing for graduate students and members of the young corporate class.  Studio apartments begin at $825.00 per month, which is comparable to, if not slightly cheaper than, other apartments in the neighborhood. [4]

Before the Sachem Apartments were built, ownership of the block was split between several private individuals,[5] but the ownership of the building itself is slightly harder to trace.  In 1945 Marry Whittier sold the property to Stanwood Realty who presumably sold or lost it to First Savings Association of Connecticut.[6] The most recent land record entry shows that in 1983, First Savings Association of New Haven sold the building to Sachem Enterprises.[7]  However, building is currently owned by Hadley Inc.[8]  The New Haven land report documenting the exchange cites Sachem Enterprises as having its office at 37 Trumbull Street.  Interestingly, the 1973 Sanborn map marks the property at that address, “Trumbull Apartments,” the same name used in Hadley Inc.’s internet address (Figure 5).  Despite the name changes, it seems that the property has only had two separate owners over the last three decades: First Savings Association followed by Sachem Enterprises and its successor, Hadley Inc.

Although people associated with Yale University have consistently lived in the neighborhoods along Whitney Avenue, these residents have not always been students.  Before apartments like Sachem enterprises were built, only New Haven’s most prominent citizens could afford to live along Whitney Avenue. 255 Whitney is located in what is, historically, one of the most fashionable neighborhoods in the city. The parcel that is now 255 used to be part of the Richard Fellows estate and was surrounded by the homes of New Haven’s rich and famous, as shown on the 1888 Sanborn map (Figure 3).  For most of its history, the lands stretching along Whitney Avenue, formerly the Hartford Turnpike, were owned almost entirely by the Hillhouse and Whitney families.[9] The 1879 New Haven Wall Map shows the Stephen Whitney estate one block Northeast of Sachem Apartments and the Hillhouse Mansion and grounds stretching along the opposite side of the street (Figure 3). Just a few blocks further down were the mansions of Eli Whitney Jr., son of the inventor, and Frederick Brewster, whose Edgerton estate is now a New Haven public park.

Although the grand mansions have, for the most part, given way to new mixed usages, notably the laboratories and parking lot of Yale’s science hill, the area retains its history.  One surviving landmark of late-1800s/early 1900s grandeur is the New Haven Lawn Club. Located at 193 Whitney Avenue, the prestigious country club at one time owned the entire block, including 255 Whitney.  Sanborn maps through the years show the evolution of the club, and one can see the building grow even as the grounds give way to doctors’ practices and, of course, apartment buildings (Figures 4, 5, 6).

As one of the main arteries in and out of New Haven, Whitney Avenue holds centuries of rich history.  255 Whitney Avenue belongs to an important era of transition within that history.  The early 1900s saw the mansions and estates along the Avenue change as the city and university expanded.  New commercial institutions and multi-family housing stretched the urban limits further along the Avenue.  Built on what was once the exclusive stomping grounds of New Haven’s wealthiest citizens, Sachem Apartments has housed successive generations of Yale students and faculty comfortably, if not quite luxuriously, for nearly a century.

It is the home of Yale University’s Organizational Development and Learning Center. The main office structure was completed in 1957 while the parking garage was added sometime before 1973. Details of the building’s make and history are chronicled in a Historic Resources Initiative Report from 1980 (exhibit 3).

The first and only other structures to stand at 221 Whitney Avenue were built in 1890. In the years leading up to development on the land, maps of Whitney Avenue between Bradley and Humphrey (exhibit 4, exhibit 5) show only four large estates on the eastern side of the street; 221 Whitney appears as an undeveloped portion of a larger estate. It was eventually separated from the larger plot, and was even halved briefly itself (exhibit 6). Each of these two plots traded owners twice over the course of the 1880’s without any development occurring on the property.

Following the death of her husband John Jarvis Matthias, Jane Keeler Matthias bought the two lots which came to composite 221 Whitney Avenue and had a 24-room, wood and stone residence with detached carriage house built on the site. Her late husband was a graduate of the Sheffield Scientific School, the son of a prominent New York Methodist Minister, and in the shipping business ; all signs indicate the family was well-to-do. As noted in a New Haven Register article written on the occasion of the home’s demolition (exhibit 7), in moving to Whitney Avenue, Jane Matthias was one of the first of many to leave downtown for what were then the outskirts: “Mrs. Matthias lived on Chapel Street, opposite the former Grace Hospital, before building the spacious home on Whitney Avenue. At that time, friends told her she was moving ‘too far out,’ and pointed out that the horse cars of the era ran only as far as Humphrey Street. In subsequent years, a great many fine homes were built along Whitney Avenue.”

After six years of living at 221 Whitney Avenue, Jane Matthias died on October 4, 1896, leaving the property to her daughter Mary Elsa Matthias. Less than a week later, on October 12 of that same year, Elsie Matthias married General Phelps Montgomery and the two moved into the inherited home, labeled in a 1904 photograph as the “Home of General Phelps Montgomery” (exhibit 8). Phelps Montgomery was, at the time, a student at the Yale Law School, but already carried distinction as a former member of the Oregon National Guard, a Yale College graduate and the grandson of Missouri Governor John Phelps. General Montgomery would go on to practice law in New Haven, holding offices on Church Street downtown. He was honored as one of Connecticut’s delegates to the Louisiana Purchase Exhibition in 1904 and with an appearance in “Who’s Who in New England” in 1915. He would serve as judge-advocate-general on the staff of Governor McLean and as alderman for New Haven’s Eighth Ward. General Montgomery was a member of the New Haven Lawn Club, located on Whitney Avenue. The Montgomerys appear to have been active and respected residents of the Avenue, New Haven, and Connecticut. They had six children.

Upon her death on May 29, 1947, Elsie Montgomery left 221 Whitney Avenue to her husband. In case of his remarriage or death, however, her will dictated that the home remain in the family, passing to three of her six children—Russell, Elsie Matthias, and Mary Marjorie. Phelps occupied the home until his death on November 13, 1954, at which time it was inherited by the three children. At the time of the sale 1956, the Register lists the house as occupied not only by Russell, Elsie, and Mary Montgomery, but their brother Ralph and his two children as well.

In 1956, the Montgomery children sold 221 Whitney Avenue to Connecticut Medical Service insurance company and the Matthias-Montgomery home was quickly demolished. Indeed, the New Haven Register noted a trend in such demolitions in the aforementioned article, titled “Whitney Avenue Loses Another Fine Residence in March of Progress” (exhibit 7); at the time of construction, both older homes and newer office buildings were visible along Whitney Avenue (exhibit 9, exhibit 10). Construction of the new offices for Connecticut Medical Service, which had previously been located at 205 Whitney Avenue, lasted from September 1956 to November 1957. Richard H. Fletcher, one of six architects employed by the Office of Douglas Orr, then located at 111 Whitney Avenue, designed the building.

Connecticut Medical Service remained at 221 Whitney Avenue through its transition to Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Connecticut and later to Anthem Blue Cross/Blue Shield; the art-deco insignias between the first and second story windows were altered to reflect the first change in name (exhibit 11, exhibit 12). However, in the 1980’s, the building’s office space was divided and leased to other tenants: the third through sixth floors to Southern New England Telephone Company in 1984; the first and second floors to Community Health Plan in 1987; and the sixth floor and basement to Promed Systems also in 1987. These leases also stipulated the divisions of parking spots in the 221 Whitney garage.

In 1998, Anthem Blue Cross/Blue Shield, which had moved offices to 370 Bassett Road in North Haven, sold 221 Whitney Avenue to Yale University for $2,500,000. With this change of ownership came changes to the building’s exterior—namely, the removal of Blue Cross/Blue Shield motifs above the first floor windows and entryway and the addition of Yale signage. Today, the building also features informal decoration placed in office windows (exhibit 13).','[]','','1957','[]','[]','Richard H.

This simple brick structure, built for industrial and commercial uses (between 1901 and 1918), has probably never made much of an impression with its architecture. Today, other than from the side alley, one hardly notices the building itself behind the large green awning. The 1886 Sanborn fire insurance map indicates that there once was a tiny, wooden icehouse at the back of the lot. In the 1901 Sanborn map the property is empty. The first indication of more substantial use of this lot can be found in the 1918 New Haven directory, which lists the tenants as Jacob Zantzer (a fireman – the only resident ever listed), Production Cutter &amp; Tool Co and Kligerman J. Furniture. The 1924 Sanborn map reflects this split, indicating a one-story brick building with four narrow spaces on the street front and a larger space in the back. The space at the back is marked as “auto repair”. The 1920 directory lists one tenant: Connecticut Bearing co. (ball bearings). In 1930 the directory lists Sterling Grille in number 298 (the second space from north). This is the first restaurant in this location. The same year Yale Cooperative Corp. Books appears in number 300, the space furthest north. A 1931 building permit indicates that a second floor is being added to the building. This may be the point when the building reached its current shape. The 1940 directory lists Merwin\'s Art Shop (with the second floor vacant) in number 294 (the southern edge) and Yale Cooperative Sporting Goods (#296). The 1950 directory lists a vacant store (#294) and Yale Coop Sporting goods (#296). In 1960 Yale Coop Sporting goods is listed in number 300. In 1965 a building permit is received for erecting a sign that says "Prexy\'s The Hamburger With The College Education". In 1970 Hungry Charley\'s receives a building permit to erect metal sign. People who studied at Yale around those days remember this simple restaurant as ‘anti-establishment alternative’ to the private club, Mory’s, next door. A seed for the current use was planted in 1974, when Michael Spoerndle, formerly a student at the Culinary institute of America (source: Wikipedia), establishes a French and Italian restaurant at number 294. In a quote in New Haven Register (January 1 1995, page A1) Spoerndle explains the origin of the name of this restaurant: "Back in Cleveland, "toad" was used to describe someone who never left the house."&nbsp;In 1967 Spoerndle receives a building permit to turn the whole building into a concert venue. Several minor alterations to the building follow, but the building itself and its use have stayed essentially the same since that date. In 2009 Toad’s place was planning to establish a roof terrace – a project that Yale opposed vehemently (Yale Daily News, September 9, 2009). This plan has not been realized to date (February 2011). Yale was listed as the owner of this building in the 1960s (for example a building permit for an exit form the second floor in 1968). At some point Yale gave the property up and EWP Realty LLC has owned it since 2003. Note: The property is currently (in 2015) listed as 300 York Street. In the past the property was split into much narrower street fronts and the addresses span from 294 to 300.</p>','[]','','1901-1918','[\'Broadway\']','[\'Brick\']','','','300 York Street, New Haven CT','41.3115398','','[\'Dynamic Broadway District\']','None','[]','[]');

In May of 1985, the owner M. Di Rienzo III paid $98,000 in alterations and repairs to the existing building. In September of the same year, Winthrop Limited obtained a variance to convert the building from 40 to 45 dwelling units, plus a janitors unit and 27 parking spaces. This was done by splitting five existing six-room apartments, one on each floor on the east side of the building, into ten three-room apartments. The building now has 45 dwelling units, plus one unit for the janitor/caretaker. Smaller cheaper apartments were apparently more profitable than expensive apartments, perhaps indicating a shift in the make-up of the local population.

The current owner is Menachem Gurevitch, of Mandy Management in Woodbridge, CT. In Feb 2008, Winthrop Terraces received notice of a fire hazard in failing to provide two means of egress from apartments 101B, 201B, 401B, and 501B (likely the extra apartments converted in 1985).

ARCHITECTURAL FEATURES: Exhibiting characteristics of both the French-inspired Second Empire architecture which was popular at the time, the building also exhibits characteristics of the burgeoning popular Queen Anne Style in American architecture. The tower element was found in both styles at the residential scale. The roof is really more of a departure from the Second Empire style because it favors a shingle roof over the mansard roofs typical of that time. It utilizes the crisp white trim of the Queen Anne style. The scale of the porch (which has not been enlarged or reduced since the 1886 Sanborn) is small for Queen Anne and the use and variety of materials and ornament is fairly subdued, relating more to the Second Empire.

BACKGROUND: From 1877 until at least 1972, the house was used exclusively as a single family owned (but not necessarily single-family occupied) residence. Four families held the title to the land over this period of time.

CURRENT AND RECENT OWNERS: It is not clear at what date the building started to be used as a commercial space. It has however been used as a funeral home for at least two decades. In 2004, the building contained Bell’s Funeral Home. The current owner, Howard Hill began his business within the existing business and by 2006 owned the building and began a renovation. He did not set out in pursuit of a career in the funeral business. He had been playing the rhythm guitar since elementary school and by the time he graduated from high school he had earned a full scholarship to Berkeley School of Music. But, in 1986, before graduating, Howard fathered a child and left school to take care of the child. Years later he would become one of the busiest Black funeral home owners in the greater New Haven area and he is a strong supporter of the community. “We have to take responsibility as Black people for excellence,” he said. “We tend to be grounded in mediocrity when the customer wants much more and won’t mind paying for it. I offer whatever it takes to satisfy my customers and they know it and they tell their relatives and friends.” He offers free seminars on how to prepare for a death in the family and is partnering with various churches to provide the same. He takes out ads in most community programs and gives $1,000 scholarships to a variety of community organizations and donates money to many others. He calls his community involvement “planting seeds.”','[]','','1887','[\'Chapel West\']','[]','','','1287 Chapel Street, New Haven, CT','41.3100889','','[\'Westward through Dwight Edgewood\']','None');

It is a one-story, 1200 square-foot brick building with load bearing masonry construction and large aluminum windows at the western-facing Dwight facade. Its lot was subdivided from the northern 139 Dwight Street lot between 1911 and 1924, according to Sanborn maps. On 139 sat a house until construction of the YMCA building in the 1920s, when the house was razed for parking. Still a parking lot today, Quality Cleaners sits behind it as a visual stakeholder on Chapel / Dwight intersection. William Candela, who constructed the building, was also the first owner of the dry cleaning business, Dwight Cleaners and Shoe Repair. This, however, did not last long; the business was sold to Edwin Astrachan in 1952 and renamed Kent Cleaners. Since then, the building and the business have been independently owned and operated, briefly housing a Dental Supply company in the 1960s, operated by Frank P. Keefe, before becoming Quality Cleaners in the mid-sixties. Today, after several years on the market, the building itself is for sale by Edward Candela of Candela Brothers. The cleaners, however, is not for sale. The building has seen several changes over the years. Immediately after its construction in 1950, the front door was relocated. Then, after its brief Dental Supply occupation, a cinderblock addition was made to the rear in 1965 before restoring it as a cleaners. In 1967 the signs that still sit on the building today were put in place. While the building has seen very little change since this date, a large push was made in the 1980s to add two stories of dwelling units above. This was to be wood frame construction and would house 4 units, to be designed by Kenneth Gelband Architects of New Haven. The building permit was requested in 1987 and granted in 1988. Several variances were made to the property to allow housing to sit so close to the property lines. In addition, the leasing of four parking spaces were required from the YMCA lot, an agreement which was signed by the Candelas and YMCA. However, after falling ill that year, owner Edward Candela lost his permit after failing to begin construction within six months of its issue. The building was marked by the Connecticut Historical Commission as “commercial vernacular” shortly thereafter and has remained in its 1967 condition ever since. While

the walls have seen little change on the interior, neither has the cleaners’ occupation; the woman operating the cleaners has been behind the counter for the last 28 years.','[]','','1949','[\'Whalley-Dwight\']','[]','','','135 Dwight Street, New Haven, CT','41.3093127','','[\'Westward through Dwight Edgewood\']','None');

Lee (on September 28th, 1956), the company sought to “remodel and renovate the face of the building by making a modern store front instead of a police station.” Toward this end, the company covered the original police precinct sign with stucco, added an aluminum awning, cleaned the brick, and replaced the main central arch with new front doors. The company also claimed other improvements as “necessary to make this building a credit to the neighborhood and the city of New Haven.” But by comparing a photo taken in 1905 (from a publication by Brown &amp; Von Beren Architects) with more modern images, one can see that the two front windows were never enlarged to make room for displays, as the J.

It is a simple rectangular commercial vernacular building dating from 1929. Perhaps its most interesting feature from the outside is the stained glass panes at the top of the storefront windows, perhaps influenced by the Art Deco movement. Two doors in a recessed entryway lead into Miya’s, which is partially divided into two by a wall that has an opening. On one side there is a bar and several tables. On the other, are more tables, as well as a sushi making station.

The site was originally a wooden home built sometime in the 19th century. In the first transaction I could find about the property, Charity Duke, wife of John C. Duke acquired the property in 1835. John C. Duke was a “colored well-known carman” who is recorded to have lived at 43 Howe Street. It is interesting that the property was in the name of a woman fairly early in the nineteenth century and especially the wife of a “colored” man, three decades before slavery finally ended in America. John C. Duke died in 1852, and it looks like his widow remarried and sold the property as Charity Lathrop, wife of Luke Lathrop, in 1860 to Mary A. Hotchkiss. She passed it on to Grace E. Hotchkiss who became Grace Doolittle and then Grace Benham. In 1876 the ownership of the property temporarily passed to Isaphene Hillhouse “to secure the payment of $3000.” After this amount was paid, the property was returned to Grace Benham in 1881. During this time, the property was most likely a rental, since upon Grace’s death in 1894 the property did not go to her still living husband, but seemed to go by default to her nephew, Harry S. Hotchkiss. He then died in 1899, leaving everything to his wife and after her death to Lucius Hotchkiss Bennett, provided he gives his mother Cora Bennett a monthly allowance, and to the Congregational Society of Naugatuck. In 1928, after Maria Hotchkiss had died, these three entities (Lucius, Cora and the Congregational Society of Naugatuck) all give up their right to the property, and it was sold to DeBussy Kusterer Company, a real estate company.

As ownership of the property passed from hand to hand, 68 Howe Street was serving as a two family rental home. According to the New Haven directory, in 1913 it was home to a Mrs. Jessie F. Carter, a stenographer for the railroad office building, and a Frederick Robinson, who worked for the Steward Rivet and Washer Co. In 1924, Henry F. Grim (a chauffer) and his wife Edith lived at 68 Howe Street along with Bertha J. Avery and Bertha K. Avery, who was a clerk for the Winchester Rifle Arms Company. In 1925, Mr. Nelson H. Jones, in the real estate and insurance business, was the last listed occupant of the house. From 1926 to 1929 the property was listed as vacant. On March 20, 1929 (several months before Black Tuesday) DeBussy &amp; Kusterer received a permit to build a masonry store costing $8,000 on the site. In 1930, The Great Atlantic and Pacific Trading Company, more commonly known as an A&amp;P, set up shop in the new building. The A&amp;P lasted through the Great Depression until 1939. During 1940 and1941 the property was again vacant and then in 1942 Mr. Charles P. Vilnis (also Vilniskis) opened up Nuway Food Market. During this period it appears that DeBussy Kusterer had tried to sell the property to Samuel Horowitz, but he never finished paying them the mortgage and instead took out a second mortgage from them. So on July 19, 1944, after the American victory in Europe, but before the defeat of Japan, Charles P. Vilnis bought 68 Howe Street. On July 23, 1951 Vilnis was granted a permit to erect a partition to divide his store into 2 stores. In April of 1952 he was granted a permit to erect a woodframe masonite belt sign. In 1953, Nuway Market continued in 68 Howe, but 68a Howe is occupied by Lottie’s Laundy, a self-service laundromat run by Mrs. Gladys Maresca, a nurse and widow of Henry E. Maresca. On April 2, 1954 Charles Vilnis was granted a permit to erect a masonry partition, presumably making the division more permanent. By the early 1960s, Lottie’s was been replaced by Nu-way Kwick Wash, a laundry run by Helen M. Vilnis, Charles’ wife.

This husband and wife team continued in the building until 1972, when Nuway Market is replaced by East West Trading Co., another grocery store, but Nu-way Kwick Wash continued in 68a. Helen Vilnis was listed alone in the directory, so presumably Charles died sometime during 1971-72. Helen Vilnis must have sold the property to the owners of East West Trading company, a Korean-American couple named Shang Jin and Sukki Hahn, because on March 3, 1972 Shang Jin Hahn was granted a permit to make minor interior repairs totaling $1,000 to 68 Howe Street as the owner. Although only the East West Trading Co. is listed in the directory for 68 Howe Street in 1984, the current owner, Yoshiko Lai, says that when she bought the property in 1985 it housed two businesses: a Korean grocery store and an American laundry. At that time she had been running Miya’s Sushi from a rented space at 1217 Chapel Street since 1982. She bought 68 Howe with the intention of slowly renovating it and moving her business there. The site was vacant from the time she bought the property until Miya’s Sushi opened there in 1991. On August 9, 1990 she was granted a permit to make interior alterations for a new restaurant including bringing the building up to fire code and making it handicap accessible. She describes the building as in very bad condition when she bought it, but with a strong foundation and a good basement. She also put in a second toilet and the kitchen. On October 24, 1990 the building was granted a certificate of use and occupancy for a restaurant limited to 48 seats. Miya’s Sushi continues at 68 Howe Street, but today Yoshiko’s son, Bun Lai, owns the business, although she can often be found there.

The history of 68 Howe Street shows the transition from residential to commercial, as the neighborhood switched from mainly Greek revival wooden houses to a mixed use neighborhood with commercial and apartment buildings. 68 Howe Street also had an interesting history of minority and female ownership from Charity Duke in the nineteenth century to Yoshiko Lai today.','[]','','03/20/1929','[]','[]','','','68 Howe Street, New Haven, CT','41.3097991','','[\'Historic Chapel West and Dwight Edgewood\']','None');

70 Howe St (a.k.a 74 Howe, 0.41 AC):

The existing building was constructed in 1929, possibly by the Rubino Construction Company. It has 6 stories with a largely unfinished basement. The building possesses 48 1-bedroom units and 21 2-bedroom units. The building has 60,600 square feet of living area and is u-shaped with one of the arms facing Howe St. while the courtyard that was created by its shape faces the neighboring 80 Howe St. Apartment building. The appraised building value for the 2001 fiscal year was $1,806,900, and the appraised land value was $123,500. The current owner of the property is 70 Howe Street LLC,              Beazley Property Management. Their office is here in New Haven. They purchased the building in May of 1999 for $2,760,000. The previous owners were Alan E. Hubbard and Peter Kursterer. They purchased the building in December of 1986 for $125,000. The actual property has been resold and bequeathed numerous times. Occupancy: 78.

80 Howe St (0.26 AC):

Also constructed in 1929 and possessing 6 stories, this building presents itself to be smaller than 70 Howe. With 40,320 square feet of living area, 80 Howe looks to be roughly half the size of its neighbor. The appraised building value was $1,460,900, and the appraised land value was $108,700 in 2001. The current owner is Ardelle B. C. Short who currently resides here in New Haven. Short acquired the property in June 1995.

Constructed in 1870 in what was the “Business AA” zoning district, these structures provided 6,720 square feet of living space within three side-by-side addresses, and were probably used only as multi-family dwelling units. As the commercial core of Chapel Street flooded into neighboring areas in the mid to late nineteenth century, the City of New Haven attempted to preserve the residential qualities of streets like York by building a number of multi-occupant townhouses between 1840 and 1900. 139-143 York is probably one of those city developments. By 1911 this town house, along with another around the corner at 313-319 Crown Street, was owned by a woman of the name Ella S. Truman.

On March 30, 1959, ownership shifted hands, as 139-143 York was sold to Yale University. In possession of real estate on the border of campus, Yale converted the townhouse into what is now their York-Crown Apartments, providing nine dwelling units for local residents. Now a component of the Chapel Street Commercial Historic District, the building is valued at $395,606 and is more specifically described as constructed of brick and clapboard siding with an asphalt roof. The City of New Haven Planning Department describes the building as a set of “Second Empire” townhouses – with its smooth grey surfaces, triangular pediments atop subtly elaborated front entries, and relatively mute ornamental façades, the building appears to be in the Greek or Neoclassical revival style. Surrounded by the Yale Digital Media Center and Crown Street, 139-143 York, along with other former town and row houses along the way, contributes to the historic quality of York Street.','[]','','1870','[\'Crown Street\']','[]','','','141 York Street, New Haven, CT','41.3074101','','[\'Historic Chapel West and Dwight Edgewood\']','None');

The square itself dates to 1830, when abolitionist Reverend Simeon Jocelyn decided to create an integrated village on the outskirts of New Haven in what was at the time a shantytown for blacks. Jocelyn envisioned a village with a nine square layout that would echo New Haven’s plan. As in New Haven, Jocelyn’s village, called Spireworth at the time, would have a green in the center square.

Spireworth Square, now called Trowbridge Square, was part of Jocelyn’s original development. He also built a few houses around the square, one of which stands today (on the corner of Cedar and Carlisle). Revered Jocelyn never completed the construction of Spireworth. Most of the homes one sees around Trowbridge Square today were the work of the Trowbridge family. Thomas Trowbridge had an estate abutting the square and built many of the houses on the square speculatively to sell to working class residents of New Haven. The first houses to be built were the Greek Revival wood frame homes on Portsea Street, which date to 1865. In 1874 Salem Street was developed with a row of identical Greek Revival houses. On Carlisle Street there was a school. Cedar Street was the last part of the square to be developed, by Thomas Trowbridge’s son, in 1885. These homes were also built to house a working class population. Judging by preservation records from 1901 the neighborhood around Trowbridge Square was solidly working class. In that year a driver, a saloon owner, and a brakeman occupied homes on Cedar Street.

Not much has changed around Trowbridge Square since the late nineteenth century. Most of the houses built by the Trowbridge family are still standing, with minor modifications. The small scale and similar style of the houses unify the square. Many of the homes also have front porches that front on the park; this enables residents to keep watch over the park and creates a sense of security. Trowbridge Square itself is of simple design. Four entrances at each corner of the park meet in the center where benches are arranged. This design makes the square easily accessible while the center area emphasizes community. The benches, lampposts, and fence are the work of the Trowbridge Square Renaissance, a neighborhood association founded in the late 1990s to revive the area. The lampposts and fence are of the same style as those found in the New Haven Green and Wooster Square. This serves to link Trowbridge Square to other notable locations in New Haven. A historic marker in the square also emphasizes the importance of the Square.

Trowbridge Square is undoubtedly a place of historic significance. It is also an essential part of the community. Its trees are a welcome change from the mostly treeless streets that surround it and the well-maintained playground is a crucial neighborhood amenity. Yet Trowbridge Square is not safe from blight and decline. The 1973 New Haven Preservation records list “deterioration of neighborhood” as a threat for every one of the houses around Trowbridge Square. The deterioration of the neighborhood (and the city) has certainly hit the Square. A couple houses and a storefront sit vacant and the Hill Youth Services center on the corner of Carlisle and Salem is shuttered. The closure of what should be a neighborhood landmark as well as a provider of essential services is foreboding.  Against these signs of decline Trowbridge Square is a beautiful and shady oasis.','[]','','c. 1830','[]','[]','N/A','','Trowbridge Square Park, New Haven, CT, 06510','41.2967424','','[\'Preservation & Renewal towards Trowbridge Square\']','None');

Upon visiting the site, I learned that the owner of the building, who calls himself Gag and also manages the liquor shop, has owned it since 1975. He said the structure has held up pretty well and he intends to keep the building in his family ownership, as it is a great location for foot traffic, being on a corner and so close to Yale.

At the New Haven Museum and Historical Society, I found a 1979 Connecticut Trust for Historic Preservation survey of the building. It sited the date of construction as circa 1940 but did not list an architect. The building’s present and historical uses were listed as commercial, and the style of the building is vernacular with modern elements. The materials were listed as composite facing concrete and brick, the roof flat, and the structural system load bearing masonry. The dimensions of the structure are 60 x 40 feet, and the structural and exterior conditions of the site were both listed as excellent. Notable features of the building include: “This building holds three storefronts on Chapel St., one with its entrance in the building’s rounded southeast corner. A pebbly composite material covers the main façade, accented by two narrow inset bands of crushed red-orange glass along the upper section.” Its historical and architectural importance read: “Though cluttered by interior and exterior signs, this post-1931 structure is intact. Reworking of the signage could create an interesting and effective commercial building.”

I also found a Sanborne map from 1956 at the museum, which provided the additional information that the walls are 12 inches thick, the building is 16 feet tall, and there were at the time (and still are) three openings for windows on the first story. I also looked at the museum’s directories dating back to the 1940’s and found that the address of the building was not listed in 1948 but was listed in 1949, so it must have been built at that time. I then checked the directories every 10 years up until the present and found that a variety of shops have been in the building, starting with Merit Laundry at 1179, Greenhouse W. Grocer at 1181, and Bob’s Liquor Store at 1183. It was interesting that 1183 always remained a liquor store, though it changed names a few times, and 1181 was a grocery store until it became a comic store in 1991. But the 1179 address changed stores every time I looked it up, from a cleaners/Laundromat to a driving school to a White Tower restaurant to a Subway to finally a Dunkin’ Donuts. I wonder if that has to do with the fact that it holds the corner location on Chapel and Park.

Finally, I visited Manuscripts and Archives and found memos dating back to 1935 that documented the ownership and tax status of the land on the corner of Chapel and Park. It seems that the plot shifted ownership from Charles Carroll to Eva Peck to Edith Golden to Esther Cuomo between 1935 and 1948. The memos also contained notes about the right to maintain the eaves, blinds, stills and leader pipes in the building and a right of way for previous owners to walk through the building. Accompanying these memos were two sketches (which I have attempted to recreate) from 1947 and 1961 documenting the angles and measurements of the building.','[]','','1940','[\'Chapel West\']','[]','','','1179-1183 Chapel Street, New Haven, CT','41.3090495','','[\'Historic Chapel West and Dwight Edgewood\']','None');

One Audubon is a very modern building that meets the needs of our society today, and the changes that this plot of land has undergone since 1886 is a wonderful representation of New Haven’s evolving cultural and urban landscapes on a larger scale. Audubon Street was previously known as New Haven’s manufacturing district and was home to many small businesses owned by both native and immigrant families.  The six-story (60,000 square foot) structure you see today was created as an extension of the Granite Square Office Building and Parking Garage that were built in 1988, and together, the buildings span an entire block. At the time, One Audubon was the first state of the art office building that had been erected in ten years, and was created to meet the demand for office and retail space. The façade is made up of polished red granite and ribbons of tinted black glass. A black aluminum grate hides the concrete façade of the parking garage. The Kagan Company builders returned to the original Italian granite quarry to ensure that the granite used to create One Audubon was an exact match to that of the Granite Square building.

Chronologically, the site of One Audubon (this part of, what we now call Audubon Street, was shown as Veto Street until the 1924 Sanborn Map) has seen very little change in built environment between 1886 and today. It appears that the large building seen on the corner of Veto and State Streets in the Sanborn Maps changed in ownership and function, but underwent minimal physical change until 2002 when One Audubon was built. It is unclear when the original building was torn down to make space for the Granite Square Office Building and Parking Garage.

The function of the building on this site seemed very dependent on the transportation industry. The 1886 Sanborn Map depicts “Fleming’s Livery and Carriage House.” The surrounding smaller buildings were devoted to carriage manufacturing and small-scale tenement housing. By 1901, the livery had changed ownership and was now known as, “Galway’s Livery.” The large space was shared by the livery and “Kelsey and Co. Manufacturers of Bicycles.” The surrounding space remained mostly residential, shifting more toward two-family flats rather than boarding houses. The 1924 Sanborn Map shows the large space shared by a 35-car garage, wood working shops, and office space. In the 1973 Sanborn Map the space is shared by an auto repair center, parking garage, and paint shop. In 1968, the city of New Haven created the State Street Redevelopment Plan in response to changes in the manufacturing industry. City planners sought to remove or renovate abandoned and dilapidated buildings on State Street to create a more modern urban environment. The site of One Audubon was included in the redevelopment plan. It is unclear exactly how the space was used between 1973 and 1988, when the Granite Square buildings were built, but the need for office and retail space was recognized by city planners involved in the State Street Redevelopment Plan.','[]','','2002','[\'Whitney-Audubon\']','[]','','','1 Audubon Street, New Haven, CT','41.3103643','','[\'State Street Stroll\']','None');

Residential (but used as mixed residential-commercial) The land at 900-910 State Street was first sold and developed in the 1880s – a few simple brick stores were built at the addresses, with frame buildings in the back of the lot functioning as storage spaces. Over the next century, additional buildings were constructed next to the originals, and various working class tenants lived and ran retail shops in the structures, which usually included a tenement space on the top floor, the store below, and a brick cellar underground. A sausage factory, bakeshop, and grocery store existed and provided identity to this block of State Street early in the 1900s, before eventually being replaced by a motorcycle repair store, bicycle shop, and the establishment of Donnarummo &amp; Demassi barbers, who existed at 904 State for over thirty years beginning in the 1920s. Tenants in the buildings changed fairly regularly, likely due to the development of the State Street area at the time – buildings were still being constructed, and the identity of blocks shifted along with the construction of new spaces and economic flux.Beginning in 1930, with the establishment of his meat store at 910 State, Carl Roessler became a figure on the block. He gradually obtained more and more land, opening a grille and tavern at 908, warehouse at 904, and factory at the addresses to the north. His establishments created an identity for the block until the late 1950s, when his death led to a downward turn for his meat business.

In 1973, a fire on the block led to the destruction of most of the properties between 900 and 910 State, leaving the area abandoned. In 1976, due to tax evasions and the bankruptcy of the Roessler family, the land was taken over by First Bank and N.B.C. Incorporated, a Connecticut company.In 1979, the New Haven Redevelopment Agency acquired the land as part of an urban renewal project for the State Street area. Over the past decade, community outcry as well as the city’s desire to revitalize the street, which had played a prominent role throughout New Haven’s history, had led to the beginning of similar redevelopment projects on nearby blocks, as well as a movement to nominate Upper State Street to the National Register of Historic Places.

In 1982, CUHO (Corporation for Urban Home Ownership) purchased the land from the city and began plans for a rowhouse project at 900-910 State. The CUHO Upper State Street Condos, eleven two and three bedroom residences that were aimed to provide an affordable housing option for New Haven residents, were constructed in 1983 and opened in 1984. In order to keep costs low, CUHO used government subsidies and chose pragmatic materials – particle board, which is both cheaper and more long-lasting than plywood, was used in construction. The condos are built in a simplified Italianate style, and boast a brick façade as well as English basements at street level (rather than conventional cellars), which provides for more usable space. A building was also constructed in the back area of the lot in order to provide more housing, and each condo has a small backyard space. Over the past twenty years, 900-910 State Street has been home to various residents as well as businesses, such as a graphic design center and barbershop. It is interesting to note the ethnic shift that the block has undergone – an insurance company catering to the Spanish-speaking community is a prominent tenant. The CUHO rowhouses will likely stand for many years to come, providing housing for shifts of residents as the economic and cultural environment of Upper State Street continues to change.','[]','','1983 (finished 1984)','[\'Upper State\']','[]','CUHO (Cooperative for Urban Home Ownership) CEO/President: Frank Nasti','','900-910 State Street, New Haven, CT','41.314682','','[\'State Street Stroll\']','None');

Although 942 is technically in a separate building from 946 and 948,  the two buildings look very similar and are connected.The arch between the two structures creates a narrow alleyway between the two buildings. In both buildings, the first floor is for commercial use and the second and third floors are residential. The storefront façade is flat with alternating window and doorway bays. There is one storefront for each of the addresses. Above this first floor commercial space, there are 3 vertical rows of large, projecting window bays, 2 rows in the building belonging to 946 and 948, and 2 rows for 942. These windows are decorated with wooden trimmings, which seem to have been done at a later date than when the building was constructed. The main entrance to each of the buildings is decorated with round arch brick motifs. (Historic Resources Inventory, Building and Structures, Hist-6, New, S, 77, 1982) This was a style that was popular for its time, replacing the trend of Second Empire French style houses that immediately preceded.

The construction of these two buildings was initiated between November 15, 1897 and March 5, 1898 for Joseph and Samuel Glaser on the previously undeveloped State Street lot which the two men purchased from Jacob H. Rubin on November 15, 1897. Much of this information is provided by a lien which was placed on the property b the Central New England Brick Exchange Company on March 5, 1898. George Brown may have been the contractor and agent for Joseph and Samuel Glaser having furnished materials and rendered services in the erection of a certain brick building owned by the Glasers. They later sold the property to Thomas P. and Edward A. Rourke on August 16, 1898. (Historic Resources Inventory, Building and Structures, Hist-6, New, S, 77, 1982). Since the original builders had no intention of living in the building, the Glasers might have been developers with their hand in other projects in New Haven. From the Sanborn maps, it appears that the size and form of the property has changed very little from the time of its construction.

Across the street from this address are a row of storefronts created as newer imitations of these original brick buildings. The stores on the street ostensibly cater to middle class customers, but none were very crowded in the middle of a weekday afternoon.  Most of the other blocks near State Street are not mixed use, but rather purely residential.

On the corner of State, Mechanic and Lawrence Streets is a 2 1/2 story, brick, commercial/industry style structure that serves as a visual focal point  of a State Street in transition. A recent article about the site from the New Haven Register points out that "the 3-acre site has had a 19th century brick building on it that housed Star Supply Company until 2006." However, in the past year a new development proposal has emerged, dramatically altering the site\'s future.

The article reveals that 1040 State Street, purchased by Post Road Residential Inc in 2014, was green lighted by the city later the same year to move ahead on a 235-unit project that "reflects a new private sector site-by-site housing boom for a city with a history of master planned grand schemes." The piece goes on to describe the new, and as of 2015, unbuilt design for the site, which would "lay flat — three and four-plus stories tall with a courtyard at its center and sidesaddle parking." While the design would eliminate much of the historic structure, architects have pointed out that it "incorporates a celebrated salvaged vestige of the 1875 building at the corner of Mechanic Street."

Historically, 1040 State Street has been a good example of local late 19th century industrial architecture in a neighborhood dominated by commercial and residential architecture. The building’s window openings have cut stone sills and brick segmental arches, and a number of the windows still have the original 6/6-pane sash. The gable on the western side of the building’s southern (Lawrence Street) elevation features “slight cornice returns” and an attic fan window, which was probably added before the turn of the twentieth century. A decorative “beltcourse” spans this elevation between the first and second stories. The main block building has a 1.5 story wing addition attached to the rear of its eastern (State Street) side.

According to The New Haven Preservation Trust, the building was probably erected in 1882 or 1883 for Thomas Forsyth on a lot that his wife Agnes purchased from William J. Atwater, Garwood Ferris, William Keeney and John Holloday on May 25, 1881. Forsyth built this structure to hold his growing business, which was called the Elm City Dye Works and Laundry by 1882. Forsyth had operated a laundry and dyeing business on the adjacent property to the north since the early 1870’s. The Forsyth family owned the property through the first decade of the twentieth century.

Throughout the 20th century, the building housed a number of different commercial and storage companies. According to the New Haven Directories, in 1915, William H. Forsyth shared the building with the New Haven Sherardizing Company, and in 1925 with Dunlay &amp; Keyes Barrels. From 1939 to 1967, the building was home to a State Machinery Corporation, an Aircraft Supply builder and an antique store. The building was only vacant for one year in 1967.

In 1968, The Heating Star Supply Company (a family-owned heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning wholesaler), began to use 60,000 square feet of the red brick building. In 2006, rapid growth and a need for more efficiency prompted the company to relocate to a 100,000 square foot building at 118 Gando Drive in New Haven.  In 2009, the property of 1040-1070 State Street (140,203 square feet) was currently up for sale, listed by The Geenty Group Realtors at a price of $3,100,000, and has been purchased for development of the State Street Lofts.','','A series of brick factory buildings were taken down to make way for the Corsair Apartments, though a one-story building at the corner of Mechanic Street has remained.

The structure is a residential building built between 1879 and 1888 whose entrance is slivered between two first floor retail spaces. These retail pieces, 978 and 982, combine with 980 to make one mixed-use unit. Denticulated cornicing, and brick pilasters isolate the frontages of each physical address. Gauged brick arches and cut stone stills denote window and door openings, and the original storefronts with the pressed entablature are intact. Attic windows are foreshortened with segmental arches set in a brick frieze above a heavily scaled band of molding.

As of 2015, 978 is home to Annandale Photography, while  982 houses Farnam Realty Group. All four residential units, which are located on the second and third floor, are and seem to have always been rented and never owned. The ownership of the building has found its way to 168 Inc., a company that owns many buildings in and around New Haven. Although this building is of no particular culture import, its story provides us with a lens through which to view the history of New Haven and the surrounding area on State Street.

The first recorded activity on the block, which borders Orange and Bishop Streets in addition to State and Edwards, was an 1859 sale of all or most of the block to the Hine Brothers by one H. J. Smith of Boston. Most of the buildings in the neighborhood were built in the mid to late 19th century, so a sale of minimally developed land at this time period makes economic sense.

 The Hine Brothers begin to sell of pieces of the property in the 1870s and 80s, and it’s also during this period that they lay down the beginnings of Hine Place, which partially bisects the block from the State Street side. The site transfers hands from J. G. Hine to George Hugo in 1889 for $4,970, which, judging by probate records for similar parcels at the time, was somewhat steep. 

Sometime between 1895 and 1901, three and one half stories go up on the lot. Ownership passes through a variety of local hands until in the 30s the building is sold to the Mechanics Savings Bank, and then to the Connecticut Savings Banks—a common Depression-era move. And although tracing a building through ownership gives us one kind of cultural information, the occupants often offer a more telling story

Through the 1950s, the occupants of this building were predominantly Irish, with last names like Kiley, Shanley, O’Brien and Hollaran. This genealogy reflects the influx of Irish immigrants coming to the northeast from Europe in the late 19th and early 20th century. Though the largest group of immigrants to New Haven was Italian, Irish people also made up a significant percentage. Like immigrants have often done, many occupants of 980 State took up menial labor, often at the Winchester Repeating Arms factory, New Haven Clock Co., and on the railroad.

After the fifties the tenant group become somewhat more diverse, with DeCarlo (Italian) and Sobolewski (Polish) taking up residence. By the eighties the building hosts a Diaz too, in keeping with the influx of minorities to New Haven in the second half of the 20th century. After that the residents all seem to be of Anglo-Saxon origin, though, as it gets later in the century, it becomes harder to make judgments about the neighborhood solely on the basis of surname. Perhaps what it might reflect is the transformation of the area from a poorer immigrant neighborhood, to a more affluent, ritzier enclave, with restaurants and a quiet, albeit present nightlife.

It was  built in 1974 with a concrete foundation and a flat roof. Although the building has an admittedly short lifespan, the actual land it sits on has undergone significant changes. The land was originally owned by W. F. Hopson, most well known for being a book plate engraver  who occasionally did work for Yale University. In 1923, the land was home to a cluster of commercial and industrial buildings--the United Advertising Corporation, a sign·making and printing store, and a lumber storage unit.

By the late 1960\'s, the effects of urban renewal began to ring down State Street, setting the stage for the structure that exists today. At the beginning of the 1970\'s in New Haven, urban renewal initiatives were making a pronounced mark in the built landscape. One of these endeavors was the Orange Street Municipal Development project, which included what would later become 843 State Street. As part of this undertaking, 843 State Street was first proposed to serve as retail·residential area and was then built as a commercial structure. In 1981, 843 State Street became the Aldrich Robert DVM New Haven Central Hospital for Veterinary Medicine. The building continued to serve that purpose up until 2014. As of 2015, it serves as the headquarters  of Citizen\'s Television Inc, the community access provider for cable television programming in New Haven, Hamden, and West Haven.

283 Crown was constructed in 1900 for residential use.(1) Around 1923, additions were made to the building (the store fronts that are occupied by present day Rumbumba and Soul de Cuba) to make room for commercial space. Additionally, an entrance, present day 25 High Street, was added to the building  to give tenants access to the apartments upstairs. Since the renovations, 283 Crown/ 25 High Street has continued to  be used for both commercial and residential use with storefronts and apartments in upper levels of the building.

Wiliam Swiman, a grocer, occupied 283 Crown from 1925 to 1940. At the 25 High Street storefront, Lee Laundry operated from the 1930s til the 1970s. (2) After the 1970s, businesses occupying the storefronts of 283 Crown and 25 High Street changed frequently, suggesting that the businesses were not doing well. Additionally, businesses shifted from selling groceries and providing everyday services like laundry to businesses that sold interior design items or specialized food items that would not be purchased everyday. (3)In the 1980s, the property owner received several foreclosure notices but the owner avoided foreclosure by getting back on track on payments. (4) 

 In 2000, The Missy LLC acquired the property for $225,000 from a family. (5) In 2003, Soul de Cuba moved into the storefront of 283 Crown. Rumbumba, another Latin American restaurant, occupies the storefront at 25 High Street.  The presence of both restaurants follows the trend of new bars and restaurants opening up in Crown Street as part of a redeveloped downtown area. Slowly, Crown Street was transformed from a largely residential area to both a residential and commercial space as seen through the transformation of townhouses to restaurants and storefronts. (6)

The Building: Structure and Architecture

The Quinnipiack Club was designed by Douglas Orr, a well-known 20th-century architect based in New Haven. Orr was known primarily for his art deco and colonial revival buildings, and designed a number of well-known New Haven buildings including The Eli (formerly the Southern New England Telephone building) and the J.W. Gibbs Lab at Yale University. The Quinnipiack Club falls into the later category: it is a colonial revival building whose design was inspired by the Federal townhouses of Charles Bulfinch in Boston. It also incorporates some features of mid-18th-century Georgian architecture from the south.

The Connecticut Historic Resources Inventory describes the building with the following: “[these elements] were melded and refined by Orr in a highly sophisticated design that was well suited to the conservative tastes of its constituency. Orr was at his best in the Colonial Revival medium and this was one of his finest examples. Details have been reduced to simple, pure forms and have been carefully ordered. The result is a building that is almost timeless.”

Structurally, it is a five-story masonry building with a brick exterior. The roof is stylistically a mansard roof, with paired end-chimneys. Each gable has a circular window. The height of the windows decreases for successively higher stories. On the second floor, false balconies “articulate” each window.

History and Uses

The Quinnipiack Club, at 221 Church St., is on the site of the former Winston J. Trowbridge House. Trowbridge had graduated from Yale in 1879, and then attended Yale Law School, graduating in 1881. In 1885, he became involved in property management and trust estates and was treasurer of the New Haven Savings bank. Although Winston died in 1864, his family completed construction of the Trowbridge house after his death. The house was occupied by the Trowbridge family until 1925 when it was taken down to make room for the new location of the Quinnipiack Club.

The Quinnipiack Club is a men’s city club that was started in 1871 to provide its members camaraderie and a respectable urban living space. It was founded at a time when this type of club was becoming increasingly popular, not just at Yale and in New Haven, but also in metropolitan cities across the globe, such as London, New York, and Washington. The building housed the club’s café, served as a meeting place for the club and provided residence to a number of members. During the 1920’s, members sought a new location because their old club location—the Darling House on Chapel Street—was constantly in need of costly repairs. They purchased the site at 221 Church in the mid-1920’s and contracted Douglas Orr as the architect for their new house. The building was completed in 1930 at a cost of about $250,000. Club meetings in the new location began in 1931.

An article from the Dana Collection authored by Quinnipiack Club members states that the new location was “designed to meet certain future requirements.” Further description includes the following: “There will be opportunity for expansion both by the addition of another floor and by the construction of another section toward the rear upon property owned by the Club…The sleeping accommodations for members who may wish to make the Club their home [and] for guests will be on the upper floors. [There are] thirty-six bedrooms of generous size with good light and air exposures…The ladies’ dining room will have a separate entrance from the street through a private lobby and reception room.”

Over the years, the building has undergone a number of internal renovations, updating the club with modern amenities. A parking lot has been added in the rear to address parking concerns. The club still has official membership, but now also functions as a bed and breakfast accepting unaffiliated guests.

According to the 1915 permit for a “brick garage and salesroom”, it was designed by architect R.W. Foote for owner N.B. Whitfield. The mason was Sperry and Treat and the carpenter was Wm. Ritchie Co. The flat roof and the large, rectangular windows are overlaid by a façade with neo-classical detail, signifying a Beaux-Arts influence. Indeed, the Historic Resources Inventory of the Connecticut Historical Commission listed the style as “Beaxu-Arts Classical (commercial)” [sic]. Interestingly, despite being specifically commissioned as an automobile show room, the building was designed at a time when automotive culture was just emerging. Cars had not yet developed a sleek and low aesthetic and there was no prominent “car architecture” yet. As a result, it is surprisingly vertical and rectilinear for an auto building. The glass storefront at ground level is a typical retail space, and the offices above are generic. Only a decorative element on the roof gives away its purpose: Foote crowned the building with a prominent sculptural relief of an automobile grill with the year “1916” carved into it.  By stylizing the automobile into a classical detail, he may have legitimized a new and still foreign modern object through relation to Greco-Roman architecture.

Being ‘generic’ has served the building well: the quality, well-proportioned spaces easily adapted to various functions through time. The ground floor housed a car sales floor, then a printing and binding company, a flower shop, and finally Trailblazer. The two floors above it were used as various offices and now - a dance rehearsal studio. Below is a more detailed account of the site and the building’s transformation.

In 1878, Governor English tore down the house known as “The Timothy Jones House” and built a new commercial and residential building. It was four stories, built of brick, with a masonry frame and a flat roof.  The exterior of the building appears to be an example of the mixed-use developments that began to pop up around the need for housing in the city. The first floor is designed for retail space, while the three floors above it appear residential. The design of the building is very much in tact today, with the same flat roof, brick façade, and evenly spaced windows across the top three floors.

As of 1886 the building was home to Grilley and Co. Platting and Capping Screw Company, which specialized in casket and saddlery hardware.  The company was known for its high quality brass work and by 1901 had expanded to occupy both the 3rd and 4th floors. The owner of the building, the English family, owned the building and the land since 1878, and in 1912 sold the building for $53,250 to Joseph Criscuolo. From the sale to Criscuolo to 1951, there were no major tenants in the building. The Sanborne Fire Insurance Maps show that as of 1924 the building was commercial on the first and second floors, and housed lofts on the 3rd and 4th floors. It is likely that the tenants in the commercial space changed pretty quickly because of the changing needs of developing State street neighborhood. At one point the building is recorded as having been the Old Universalist Church, and also a commercial and office space.

In 1951 the building was sold for $185,000 to the Perlroch Company. Again, from this point on the space appeared to be used for both commercial and residential uses. Currently, the building is occupied by the Olde School Saloon and Bistro, which opened in 2010. A few other restaurants had been in and out of the space since the 1950s. The use of the building has changed over time along with the needs of the neighborhood, but the structure of the building has been able to accomodate the changing functions since 1878.','[]','','1867','[\'Upper State\']','[]','','','418-422 State Street, New Haven, CT','41.30606849999999','','[\'Business and Commerce east of the Green\']','None');

In the early 20th century, between 1888 and the foreclosure in 1934, the building served as the storefront for Harris R&C Co., a liquor store operated by Richmond Harris. Harris eventually owned the site, but began operations by leasing the storefront in 1905. At the time when he leased the storefront for his liquor business, the property was owned by Timothy Bishop, who passed the property on to his children before it was eventually sold to Harris. Timothy Bishop inherited the site from E. Huggins Bishop when E.H. passed away in 1882. The earliest record of E.H. Bishop owning the property is in 1868, and it is unclear who its previous owner was. Although Bishop owned the property, the storefront was occupied in the late 19th century by the Stowe and Schoonmaker Commission House. According to the Connecticut Historical Society, in 1888, the previous building on the site had been demolished and replaced by the current structure. However, examination of the Arnold Dana Collection has revealed that the previous structure was remodeled in 1888, not completely demolished. The central change in the structure was the addition of a third floor, eliminating the slanted roof and leaving the building with its current rectangular shape. In its previous incarnation, the building was the storefront for the Stowe & Schoonmaker Commission House. The building was constructed in its original form in 1817. It is unclear whether there was any structure on the lot between 1784, when Crown Street was dedicated, and 1817. Prior to 1784, the lot was on the border of the estates of Timothy Brown and William Lyon, according to a 1748 map. In a 1641 map, the lot was part of the estate of Thomas Jeffrey.','Original unknown; renovated by Timothy Bishop','[\'Commercial\']','[\'Load-bearing masonry\']','[\'Italianate\']','[\'Yes, business hours\']','','3','248-250 State Street building is an Italianate style architecture located on the northwest corner of Crown Street and State Street, and it is currently occupied by Café Nine, a live music venue.

It is now owned by AT&amp;T, and exemplifies late 1970s architecture. The abstract low reliefs on Court Street, and on the back of the building are particularly notable, as is the gallery of the façade.

The block: Pitkin Alley – State St – Court St

The lot on which the SNETCo building was built used to be one block with Pitkin Alley on the South –named after the later owners of the lots on both sides of the alley, and Court Street on the North side. The first known owner of the block was Capt. Ezekiel Hays, and the house that he built there remained in the hands of military men until the end of the 19th century.

The State Street Redevelopment and Renewal Plan &amp; the SNETCo Building

In the context of urban of Urban Renewal, the businesses of 372-415 State Street (now 400 State) were relocated, starting in 1969. The last relocated occupant of the “pigeonhole block” was Mr. Ferraro of Mohawk Market, who had managed to sign a document saying he could stay on there until the Redevelopment authority had built across the street on State Street. He eventually had to move in 1973. The first mention of any activity after that is in 1981: The AFL-CIO – Communication Workers of America. We can therefore assume that the SNETCo building had been built at that time. Yet it was most likely built as late as 1979-1980, because it is still listed as “project” in the 1979 Amendment to the renewal plan. At a larger scale, it is interesting to notice that it is the only building of the renewal plan that ended being built.','[]','','1979-1980?','[\'Downtown\']','[]','','','400 State Street, New Haven, CT','41.3057793','','[\'Business and Commerce east of the Green\']','[]','[]','None');

"We like the location because you are in the center of everything," says employee Jay Smilovich from A.D. Perkins Company, which manufactures stamps and signs, though he says that the number of parking tickets that his customers receive while visiting is a definite downside. The store was built, and continues to be used, for a combination of commercial and industrial uses: despite its relatively small footprint, 43 Elm Street has storefront counters as you walk in, a few desks for office work off of that, and machines for Perkins\' materials\' manufacturing in a back room and in a finished basement. The newspaper article from 1952 described the store as follows: “There is an asphalt tile floor…and an office partition…which is broken up in modern design with window panes open at the top for ventilation…The new type and molding room is well lit with two large six foot burglarproof windows…The assembly room has 14 ft. by 45 ft. with new machinery and racks for stock handles.” Though tile floor aside, the most distinctive part of the building today is undoubtedly its porcelanized sign that has white steel letters on a green background. The sign was lit up for many years, but a tree planted by the city grew up too close and broke it, so now it hangs there unlit and slightly damaged.

A.D. Perkins itself is the oldest retailer in New Haven, with a full-time presence (confirmed by old advertisements) in the city since 1879. Perkins\' building shares walls described on a 1961 Sanborn Map as "pilast\'d" with two other retailers on the block, which in 1951 were Lundblad\'s Jeweler\'s and Anderson\'s Opticians. They bought the lot from S. Loeb &amp; Sons, described in a 1952 newspaper article as “a local real estate man.” Despite the shared or party walls, the three storefronts are not identical; Perkins\' building goes further back into the lot. All three of those businesses moved into their spaces simultaneously as soon as they were ready for occupancy, though the latter two have since been replaced.

Because 43 Elm Street came into being with the current building, it is impossible to trace the history attached to that particular address beyond its founding year. However, the plot of land around 43 Elm Street can be traced back using Sanborn Maps and old atlases, and evidence from these sources provides snapshots of its history. In 1641, almost the entirety of Elm Street between Church and State (or their equivalents at the time; Orange Street did not exist then) was owned by the Eaton family. By 1748, the next map available in the Whitney Library\'s collection, the block was split between Jo Noyes, Michael Todd, and S.A. Bishop, listed as a priest, a merchant, and a farmer, respectively. As of a Doolittle map from the year 1824, there is no building pictured in the vicinity of what is now 43 Elm Street; it appears to be a rather enjoyable pasture. It takes until the 1911 Atlas of New Haven to see true construction on the site: next to what would become 43 Elm Street are two buildings owned by Imperial Granum Co. One, a masonry building, still stands today, while the other, made of wood, had been torn down by the time a 1923 Sanborn Map was made, leaving only the Visiting Nurse Association as a far neighbor of the old Imperial building. This paved the way for the three new and connected stores to be constructed there in 1951.','[]','','1951','[\'Downtown\']','[]','','','43 Elm Street, New Haven, CT','41.307677','','[\'Business and Commerce east of the Green\']','None');

Olive and Artizan Streets enclose the Fire Headquarters on the east and west, respectively, and a parking lot is located in the rear.  Prior to the construction of the station, St. John Street intersected Olive and terminated at Artizan, creating a small, trapezoidal lot of around 8,750 square feet upon which the Milner Hotel (formerly the Avon Hotel, 192?-1944) stood.  The City of New Haven purchased this lot from the hotel chain on February 10th, 1960 at the price of $305,000, explicitly for the purpose of a new municipal fire headquarters.  On the corner of Olive and St. John stood the old Olive Street Station which housed three engine companies, all of which would relocate across the street to the new firehouse.  During construction of the Central Headquarters, the small portion of St. John Street between Artizan and Olive was removed in order to provide space for a parking lot.  The altered block has been the site of the Fire Headquarters since 1961.

The same year construction was completed the Central Fire Headquarters won the Progressive Architecture award, hailed as a “Utilitarian Landmark.”  Architect Philip Johnson, who was serving as one of the jurors, commented, “It is not easy for me to sympathize with this stage-set, Expressionist, New Brutalist, Yale approach, but I do defend their right to say this.”

In sketches by Carlin, the Headquarters is portrayed as a grand structure, graced by pedestrians strolling along streets lined with various multi-use buildings.  While the modern Grand Avenue streetscape never quite developed into this imagined ideal, the Headquarters itself has withstood the past 50 years extremely well.  No major construction has been necessary and only minor renovations such as new air ducts and storm windows have occurred – even the original brass firepoles are still in use.  A truly utile, monumental, and enduring building, New Haven’s Central Fire Headquarters still serves its purpose as both a municipal firehouse and an architectural gateway into Wooster Square, and will most likely remain so for years to come.','[]','','1961','[\'Wooster\']','[]','Earl Carlin, Peter Millard, Paul Pozzi','','952 Grand Avenue, New Haven, CT 06511','41.3069746','','[\'Grand Avenue: Gateway to Fair Haven\']','None');

In 1999, the station transitioned to be only channel 8 and myTV channel 9.  The studio sits on the intersection of Elm and State streets marking the boundary between downtown New Haven and the Wooster Square Neighborhood— a location representative of its role as both a central city business and a key player in the daily lives of locals.

WTNH has been the sole tenant of 8 Elm St, but the building has undergone two sales among the telecommunications affiliates of WTNH.  On January 1, 1986 an unknown owner, which could be stipulated to be the DuMont Television Network, sold the property for $2,000,000 to Cook Inlet Communications.  On December 29, 1994 Cook sold to Lin Television Corporation for $7,570,000.  Lin Television Corporation remains the owner and current affiliate of WTNH.  Since its construction the building has depreciated by thirty percent.[2]  The exterior appearance of this brownstone has not changed since 1982 but for the introduction of a darker brick pattern on the ground floor walls after a 1999 remodel of the first floor interiors.

In the earliest days of the New Haven Colony, residents began to build small, frame houses in the area, where local commerce, such as shoemakers, also began to settle. The Hill began to develop in earnest around 1800, and the first subdivision took place in 1812. During the period when the Farmington Canal sparked New Haven’s increasing prosperity and mercantile strength in 1825, the Hill saw a steady increase in housing, which consisted of frame buildings one or two stories high with a gable end on the street. This period of time also marked the completion of the first State Hospital Building.2

The mid-nineteenth century marked the rise of the Hill as a dense and vibrant residential area, which would later explode with people during New Haven’s manufacturing and transportation boom during the second half of the nineteenth century and into the early twentieth century. New streets, such as Prince and Gold Streets—two that border Amistad Park today—began to divide the neighborhood, and increasing numbers of residents settled into tenement houses and apartment buildings [See Figure 1]. Though the Hill previously housed blacks and poor whites, middle class residents began to move into the neighborhood as foreign immigrants settled into the older downtown areas of the city. To meet the demands of the growing population, commerce also increased, as did the number of small neighborhood churches.

The twentieth century eventually brought what city officials saw as the decline of the neighborhood. Motivated to escape the increasing housing density and the newest influx of immigrants, middle-class residents fled to new streetcar suburbs and were replaced by eastern European and Italian immigrants. The number of tenement houses and duplexes increased markedly to accommodate the number of families in the area. What these neighborhoods lost in affluence, they gained in density, local commerce, and diversity. Along the streets bordering the plot where Amistad Park now stands, small businesses that sold everything from meat to dry goods to paint to watches and shoes were mixed in with the great number of residents.3 The blocks, lined with brick and wooden frame buildings, came to resemble the kind of block of which Jane Jacobs would approve [See Figure 2].

After World War II, New Haven engaged in massive urban renewal efforts, receiving the most federal urban renewal funds of any other city in the country. The highway projects of the 1950s and 1960s hastened the flow of affluence out of the city, leading to the expansion of blighted areas. According to the New Haven Historic Resources Inventory, “the scattered pockets of poverty in the Hill area soon spread. Middle class residents moved out and low-income, predominantly minority families moved in. A spiral of disinvestment started. Partly because of the severe density of the neighborhood, buildings deteriorated rapidly.”4 Drug trafficking and prostitution also became prevalent in the area.5 In an effort to revitalize the area and New Haven’s lagging economy and job market, the New Haven Redevelopment Authority adopted the Hill Renewal and Redevelopment Plan [See Figure 3]. Pressured by the city, Hill residents began to leave the neighborhood. Where densely packed apartment complexes stood in 1968, buildings stood vacant by 1970, and by 1980, the entire block of Cedar Street from Prince Street to Washington Avenue was completely cleared [See Figure 4].6

The year 1981, however, marked a shift in urban renewal thinking. City officials and the New Haven Redevelopment Authority began to focus more on rehabilitation than on demolition for the Hill Neighborhood. Also, community groups like the Upper Hill Project Area Committee (UHPAC) began to spring up and unite area residents. 7 In 1987, New Haven and the Schnip Development Corporation applied for up to $10 million in Urban Development Action Grant (UDAG) from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), which gave money to cities in severe economic distress. Amistad Park was part of the Downtown South-Hill North Project proposal to revitalize a 40-acre site that city officials deemed to be “mostly vacant and blighted.”8 The proposal included plans to develop hundreds of new housing units, some specifically for “low-moderate income occupants, and 1,400,000 square feet of commercial space, including office and medical-related facilities, as well as a hotel, conference center and health club.”9 Schnip intended for the project to complement the Washington Center Project, another revitalization project proposed by minority developer Washington Center Associates.

Amistad Park’s site is part of a larger story of urban development and city planning and the difficulties that come with both. First, due to community opposition and fundraising difficulties, the proposed Washington Center Project was never built and the Downtown South-Hill Project never fully completed. Original plans now obsolete, city officials and Schnip Corporation persuaded the city’s board of aldermen to rezone and revert the parcels within the development property, which had been classified as a Planned Development District (PDD). This reduced the size of the development project and made room for smaller developments, such as the Lulac Daycare center.10

Remnants of the development were completed, such as New Prince Street and its passive park, both of which would later be renamed to celebrate the famed slave revolt on the Amistad ship. Much of the housing and retail space no longer exists or was never built, and Yale now owns many of the properties that would have been included in the Downtown South-Hill North Project. Many of these properties now house research facilities and office space, and the former Richard C. Lee High School— named after the mayor who oversaw much of the city’s urban renewal—became Yale’s School of Nursing. Architect Herb Newman oversaw much of the design, construction and renovation of the Yale buildings, including the construction of the Amistad research building, which came to public attention last year when the murder case involving Annie Le broke headlines. The park itself, went through a number of design iterations, ranging from a pattern of asymmetrical paths like that of the New Haven Green to the design we see today with a center circular lawn. Courtland Wilson, executive director of the Hill Development Corporation justified the park’s role in the development: “We don’t have parks in the Hill where you can sit, like the Green or Edgewood Park. This would fill the void very well.”11 Landscape architects Towers|Gold (formerly Rolland/Towers) drafted the final design in 1991, and construction on the park finished in 1992 [See figure 5]. Today, the park still remains a passive park under Yale’s ownership and the management of CDC, LCC.

The Downtown South-Hill North Project and Amistad Park bring up some really interesting questions regarding the role of planning in economic recovery. The project was initially designed to “provide a substantial number of jobs for the City, including 737 new permanent jobs, some for low- and moderate-income and minority residents, and 315 jobs during the construction period.”12 According to a brief on the proposed disposition of Lee High School, “the Mayor [of New Haven] has believed that this 40-acre area cannot be revitalized unless done comprehensively. For this reason, the Mayor imposed a moratorium on piece-meal development of the area, and in February, 1986, named Schnip as Preferred Developer for Planning for this entire area.”13 The ultimate failure of the comprehensively planned project reveals many of the obstacles in this discourse of urban planning—namely, logistical feasibility, equity, and effectiveness. Also, in looking back at the history of the property as a residential and commercial center, it seems appropriate to wonder whether the neighborhood would have fared better had city officials simply left it as it was.

Amistad Park serves as a constant reminder of the limited number of residents in the area. What the city and Schnip Development Corporation saw as a neighborhood amenity for the diverse community of Hill residents now stands often empty, save for the occasional group of Yale researchers having lunch or Yale Medical School’s annual commencement. In 1992, the quincentennial year of Columbus’s discovery of the Americas, Amistad Park officially opened, and officials unveiled a bronze art installation that artist Roger Di Tarando created to commemorate the many cultures that contributed to our nation’s history [See figure 6]. The irony seems all too appropriate: celebrating the many cultures and people that Columbus helped to destroy with a piece that marks the entrance to an empty passive park that was designed for people its construction helped to displace. Today, Amistad Park disguises its rich but troubled past with its carefully manicured and diligently maintained lawn and plantings, hiding any clue about the people and communities who used to live in its place.

The building was completed in 1961, making it contemporary with the Southern New England Telephone building and the College Plaza Shopping Center (image 2), all located on College street surrounding the Connector. 196­-212 College shares a very similar aesthetic to the SNET building and the shopping center, all of which have vertical aluminum ridges rising up between each column of windows on their facades. While the emphasis on verticality is appropriate for the low­rise SNET building on George and College, it is less fitting on the two story 196­212 College and the Plaza Shopping Center which both have a much stronger horizontality. The aesthetic choice was made in order to fit all of these buildings into a cohesive new cityscape that New Haven intended to create in order to reinvigorate the area surrounding the 1959 Oak Street Connector. All of these redevelopment buildings are steel frame construction with aluminum cladding and details on the facades. The ground floor of 196­212 College and the College Plaza Shopping Center are brick and masonry respectively, differentiating the ground floor retail from the upstairs office spaces. The 1959 for the Oak Street Connector required the demolition of many of the existing buildings in the area in order for the new redevelopment plan to come to fruition.

Prior to the construction of 196­212 College Street the site was occupied by a local clothing store called Albram\'s Clothing Incorporated. When the current building was built in 1961 it included eight retail spaces and office space on the second floor. Albram’s Clothing Inc. was one of the building’s first tenants occupying the space in 210 College street. All of the building’s retail spaces were initially filled with clothing stores which reflected the area’s former character as a tanning, leatherworking and garment district.

The initial tenants were Town Shoes in 202, AH Brown Leather Goods in 204, Fenmore Hats in 206, Felmont Maternity Shop in 208, Albram’s Clothing Inc. in 210 and Samuel’s Shoes in 212. In the first year after completion 12 of the building’s 14 second floor office spaces were vacant, the only two occupants being the Mass Indemnity &amp; Life Insurance Company and Powder Actuated Tool Manufacturers.

By 1964 Joseph’s Custom Tailoring had moved in to occupy the 198 College. Upstairs offices were occupied by insurance companies, credit companies, and claims agents.

In the 1967 New Haven Directory Sue Jean Tall Clothing Shop had moved into 196 and Joseph’s Custom Tailoring was replaced by a Christian Science reading room that would stay until the mid-1990s. The first occupant, Albram, was replaced at 210 by Ted Cooper\'s Clothing Shop. AH Brown Leather Goods was also replaced in 204 by Zinn Furs Inc. Changes in the late 60s are significant because non­-clothing businesses moved into the retail spaces, signifying the area’s move from being a specialty shopping district towards becoming part of an active downtown New Haven area that serves a variety of local communities.

1972 New Haven directory indicates that the Goodway Copy Center moved into the previously vacant 196 College and Kelly Services Labor Division moving into 202 to replace town shoes. AH Brown Leather Goods at 204 and Fenmore Hats at 206 were replaced by Weinstein\'s Shoes, and a Dr. Scholl\'s Foot Comfort Shop respectively.

By the late seventies Kelly Services had moved out of 202 and Goodway moved to replace it. Cartier Opticians also moved into 208 in place of Felmont Maternity Shop.

The growing importance of this downtown area is also reflected with the construction in 1970 of the Crown Street Parking Garage across the intersection from 196­212 College. This massive parking structure has a capacity of 750 cars in order to handle the greatly increased volume of people working in and visiting the downtown area.

The larger amount of people coming to the area facilitated the change from clothing retailers to restaurants and services occupying 196­–212 College. By 1984 we start to see some familiar stores enter the building as College Wines open at 212, where Samuel\'s Shoes had once been. Ashley\'s Homemade Ice Cream also moved into the vacant spot at 196 College. In 1991, Cooper\'s (now a dress shop) was the only clothing store left in the building after the closing of Dr. Scholl\'s. Scarpellino\'s Restaurant had moved into 204, the former location of Weinstein\'s Shoes, and Park Plaza Rosebud had replaced Cartier Opticians in 208. Park Plaza Rosebud would move out before 1995 leaving 208 vacant. By 1995 B.R. &amp; A. Engineers had moved into 200 College and Sera Nail Salon occupied 206. By 1999 the Christian Science reading room moved out and left 198 vacant. B.R. &amp; A. Engineers in 200 was replaced by Empire Financial Group and the Goodway Copy Center, after going through a series of rebrands during its time in the building, moved out. Through the late 80s and 90s, New Haven’s depressed economic state is evident in the multiple vacancies in 196­212 College left by departing organizations.

The most recent directory from 2005 showed Ellas &amp; Eros Beauty Salon in 196, Vierra Home Improvement in 202, Scarpellino\'s Restaurant still in 204, Sera Nail Salon still in 206, The Great Connecticut Jazz Festival in 208 and Cooper\'s and College Wines still in 210 and 212 respectively. Cooper\'s was the only longstanding store that occupied 196­212 College Street, having lasted around 40 years. By the end of it\'s time there it had gone from being a general clothing store to a feminine apparel specific outlet. One Yale student recalls Cooper\'s as "that sleazy lingerie store next to College Wines"1 showing us how the store’s reputation took a downturn since its opening in the 60s.

The rest of the story has been gathered through personal observations, news archives and inquiries at the institutions closest to 196­212 College (The adjacent parking lot and the Coop High School across the street). In 2006 a plan was approved to demolish 196­212 College street and replace it with a high rise residential and retail tower called College Square (image 3), designed by Robert A.M. Stern architects and financed by Centerplan. The project would include 272 luxury apartments, parking and over 50,000 square feet of retail space.2 In the 2008 economic recession a lack of funding for the project caused it to go on hold indefinitely.

When I first arrived to New Haven in 2009 College Wines was the only store I remember being in the building, the rest of the storefronts were vacated in anticipation of the building’s scheduled demolition. College Wines closed later that year. Now in 2012, although the building’s abandon is clearly visible in its dilapidated retail spaces it is again showing signs of life. The Cooperative High School, which moved into their new building across the street 

from 196­212 College in 2009 is using a few of the old retail spaces for afterschool programs like the New Haven Student Journalism Project and the Coop Creative Arts Center. The People’s Art Collective now occupies 212 and the Sustainable Furniture Initiative occupies 202. The presence of these new organizations fits well into the current urban revival New Haven has had within the last several years. Organizations like the People’s Art Collective and the Sustainable Furniture Initiative represent a new trend of inner city gentrification that has captured sections of New Haven in the 21st century. For now 196­212 College street remains standing. With no active plans for its destruction and new organizations moving back into its vacant retail spaces it stands as an ongoing testament to the rich history of the downtown New Haven area.

History of S.Z. Field Printing Press:

Samuel Z. Field moved to New Haven in 1890 and set up a fruit and confectionary business on Grand Avenue. However, he eventually had more success with printing and stationary. He bought the lot of 38-44 Crown St. sometime between 1910 and 1913 from a real estate broker named Charles H Webb. While the Field Building was being constructed his business was located on State Street. The printing press remained at 44 Crown St. until Field’s death in 1939 when the building and company was sold to Carleton S. Read. Ownership of the company and building were passed through his descendants until at least 1981.

The last record of the S.Z. Field Company in the New Haven Directory was in 1990. After that, directories show that the building was vacant (at least until 2006). However, the building was said to have been deteriorating since the late seventies according to Alan Greenberg, owner of ACME furniture across the street (source: The New Haven Independent).

 

Description of Building:

The Field Building is one of the few remaining commercial buildings constructed during the late 19th to early 20th century in New Haven. Many commercial buildings were built at this time to replace old tenement housing.

The building itself has 4 stories and a basement with approximate dimensions of 48 by 120 feet. It is 3 bays wide with a flat roof. The windows on the side bays are paired while the windows in the middle bay have 3 parts.  Unlike the front windows, the side windows are arched. The front façade features cut-stone pilasters and surround with foot scrolls that are supposed to create a classical and dignified air.

The original cornice had been removed and the building now has a pressed-metal cornice and aluminum frames in the entry.

History of Alterations to the Field Building:

1/1/39

“Alter store front”

12/16/41

“Remove Cornice”

10/5/48

“Relocate existing opening to elevator”

7/15/59

“Erect fire escape.”

3/24/61

“Fourth floor: Remove present masonry construction and replace rigger to take out and replace some machinery on this floor”

***This alteration is likely the cause of the odd shape of the 4th floor center window.

5/28/65

“Erect sign ‘S.Z.Field Co’”

11/9/70

“Alter store front and interior alterations”

(From New Haven Building Permits)

The addition to the first floor in the back of the building was constructed between 1913 and 1915 according to the Historic American Building Survey.

According to the Connecticut Historical Commission, the pressed-metal cornice and storefront was also altered in 1965.

Recent Events:

In 2004 the Field Building (and a couple other buildings on Crown Street) was bought by a private development group, College St LLC, owned by David Nyberg. However, after no significant renovations were made to the building (and specifically after some gutting of plumbing and wiring on the second and third floors), preservation groups began to protest the apparent negligence by the developer. In 2010 the Board of Zone Appeals handed management of the building to the Philadelphia based PMC Property Group. They started rehabilitation and renovation of the building in January of 2012 and sought to preserve some of the original elements of the building (namely the windows, wood flooring, beams and brickwork).

While local New Havenites may not say it is attractive, they will admit that “it is recognizable” with its eighteen-story limestone façade cutting sharp angles and its clean modernist lines. Based upon architect William Pederson’s design, and erected in 1972 by the Dwight Building Company for the New Haven Savings Bank, the building clearly reflects the era’s desire to recreate the downtown as a clean modern city. An advertising pamphlet from its opening plainly reveals this agenda, as its attempts to entice potential tenants “…poised with landmark proportions across from the historic New Haven Green, at the hub of a thriving community, the New Haven Savings Bank Building Reflects the spirit of Progress which is the city’s New England heritage.” It goes on to say, a “symbol of the dramatic upsurge of downtown New Haven, and of the limitless growth of the East Coast business community, One Ninety Five Church Street is a most distinguished address.” Furthermore, it boasted the most modern technologies of the time, such as modern climate control, and high-speed, computerized elevators. While three of its floors were meant to house the New Haven Savings Bank (now First Niagara Bank), the rest were intended for leasing and have been filled by a variety of industry’s, including lawyers, accountants, and real estate agents.

While the corner of Elm and Church Streets has long been a hub of the city, it has not always been a thriving business center. A map from 1641 indicates that the plot of land belonged to an elder of the town, and neighbored the reverend John Davenport. Though the corner already housed notables of the society, in 1641 the square was purely residential. However, by 1742 the White Haven Society, a break-away from Center Church, had built their “Blue Meeting House,” and are the derivation of the name Church Street. While their numbers eventually dwindled under the dry words of Jonathan Edwards, by 1824 the land had been left as a parsonage lot. However, by 1845 inventor and rubber manufacturer Charles Goodyear inhabited one of the four row houses, known as St. John’s Place, that had been built on the site. Then by 1869, a larger row known as The Sheffield Block had been erected around the corner on Elm Street. These new structures represented the changes of the city and the growing density of the downtown.

With the city growing it is little surprise that, sometime between 1901 and 1911, St. John’s Place had been turned into a primarily commercial building and then again by 1916 had been razed to make room for the Colonial Building. The Colonial Building was a commercial, five-story building that housed a brokerage firm, Gilberts Restaurant, and a series of professional offices in the upper floors. Then around the corner the Sheffield had experienced similar, albeit less dramatic, change as a series of small restaurants were tacked to its façades.

Physically the corner remained largely unaltered until the 1970s, although it seems that it suffered the same economic depression that much of the rest of downtown New Haven suffered during this era. And by the early 1970s part of the corner had made its way into the hands of the Redevelopment Agency. In 1972 the entire corner was cleared to make way for the New Haven Savings Bank Building that stands there today. The erecting of the new building was a feat appropriate to the times, as a Silkorsky helicopter carried 132,000 pounds of air conditioning and heating equipment to its roof. And while the building clearly speaks to the ideals of another era, it is still relevant today as it continues to be occupied and well kept up. Also, while the corner is no longer composed of small restaurants with offices above, the building does offer a restaurant, a newsstand, and gym facilities within. Today, the building is home primarily to law firms and real estate offices, all though other groups such as the Arts Council of Greater New Haven can be found there as well.','[]','','1973','[\'Downtown\']','[]','William Pederson','','195 Church Street, New Haven, CT','41.3078256','','[\'Business and Commerce east of the Green\']','[]','[]','None');

Edward P. Evans Hall, designed by Norman Foster, lends Whitney Avenue a modern, glassy feel; once inside, it boasts a grassy courtyard, massive art installations, and state-of-the-art lecture facilities. But one cannot help sensing that a stately brick structure like 175 Whitney, with history, rather than computer monitors, embedded in its walls, would better fit with its surroundings.**</p><p><br></p><p>“Should Yale’s New School of Organization and Management Demolish&nbsp;and Replace these two important Whitney Avenue Buildings?” This question poses itself in bold font to any person that ventures upon the New Haven Preservation Trust’s website. One of these “important” buildings is 175 Whitney Avenue (Image One). As you approach the red brick building today, its elevated entrance crowned by a balustrade and pediment above a niche of cast stone stand out (Image Two). First floor sash window in recessed arches of cast stone mirror the arched entrance niche, which in turn mirrors a carefully detailed domed entrance room. The façade and waiting room are largely all that remain unchanged about this historic building. </p><p>Although the building now holds Yale’s Internet Technology Services, it was originally built in 1924 to house the new home office of Security Insurance of New Haven. The only insurance company ever chartered in New Haven, Security Insurance faced the task of erecting the first large commercial building on the largely residential Whitney Avenue. The company chose Connecticut born and Yale educated architect Henry Killam Williams to design a fireproof office building for their $419,000 facilities. Notes from William’s personal files indicate he and the company’s Vice President agreed on a “domestic” and Georgian style for the building, using local red brick, attesting to New Haven’s colonial heritage. The symmetrical, rectangular building was set sixty feet back from the street and occupied of only a third of the original 250 foot wide lot, demonstrating Security’s desire for the building to blend with its surroundings. </p><p>Nevertheless, the new office contrasts markedly with the residency it replaced. The Judge Wayland House was much smaller and sat even further back on the property consisting of mostly open space. Ezra C. Read, president of the City Bank of New Haven and director of the New York, New Haven, Hartford Railway commissioned the house in 1835 as his personal residency on his estate. When Read died in 1875 his estate passed to his son-in-law Francis Wayland who served as probate judge of New Haven and Lieutenant governor of Connecticut in the 1860’s and Dean of Yale law school in the 1870’s. Security Insurance bought the property from Wayland’s niece, Frances Williams, in 1923 in order to build its offices. Despite making multiple interior renovations to the building and constructing connecting facilities at 155 Whitney, in 1964 Security Insurance of New Haven decided to change its name to Security Insurance of Hartford and to cut all ties to its charter city. </p><p>In the same year Yale Univeristy bought both 175 Whitney and the adjacent 155 Whitney, although Security Insurance remained in the building through the beginning of 1965. A permit to do interior alterations on 175 Whitney, granted to Yale in 1967, classifies the building as a computer center, still its principal use today. Since this time Yale has sought multiple permits for extensive interior renovations. Internally, only the two-story domed entrance hall, remains as Henry Killam William designed it. This month Yale’s ITS department will move to new offices within Science Park. Yale’s SOM has already contracted Norman Foster to design the future facilities at 155 and 175 Whitney. Construction of the new 230,000-square-foot building is projected to be completed in the fall of 2011. Although no mention has been made of preservation of the current building, Yale declares that the new LEED certified building “will be site-specific and sensitive to the surrounding neighborhood.”</p>','[]','','1924','[\'Whitney-Audubon\']','[\'Brick\', \'Glass\', \'Stone\']','Henry Killam Williams','','175 Whitney Avenue, New Haven, CT','41.315393','','[\'Industry & Luxury around Prospect Hill\']','None','[\'Commercial\']','[\'Outbuilding\']');

New Haven city directories track residents as far back as 1913, at which time James J. Lawton lived at 15 High Street. Lawton, born in 1849, was the manager of Fleischmann Co., a yeast manufacturer. According to the Connecticut Historical Commission Building Survey of 1982, the home’s earliest owner was Dr. Elmer W. Ferguson, circa 1913. Lawton’s mention as resident in the 1913 directory leads me to believe that either Lawton sold the property to Ferguson shortly after purchasing it, or Ferguson had been renting his property to Lawton in 1913. Ferguson, a chiropractor, lived in the home until the late 1970s. The property functioned as both his home and office—he saw patients in an office and examination room in the front left side of the house, a space now converted to bedrooms.

The city directory curiously omits a tenant’s name for the property in the 1980s, and was purchased by Salatto Real Estate in 1990. The real estate firm is named for two brothers, Joseph and James, who still own and manage many downtown properties. In 1999, the home was inhabited by Asha Richards, and from 2001-2006, by C. Yanicelli. The home was then dubbed the Theta House, functioning as a residential space for Yale students in the university’s Kappa Alpha Theta sorority. In 2010, Theta moved to a house on Crown Street, and Salatto began to fill 15 High Street’s 7 bedrooms with members of Yale’s Fence Club. The club houses weekly meetings in one of its first floor spaces, and weekly parties in the first and second floor common spaces. The home has a narrow backyard where events are also hosted, and a balcony where club members hang out. Though the location of the Fence House is, in many ways, optimal—close to other student housing, campus’ center, and High and Crown Street restaurants and bars—the home has been broken into a number of times in the past two years during attempted robberies.','James J.

It was, according to historian Edward Atwater, one of the first streets laid out in 1784 by New Haven’s settlers, and grew in length during the following years. It was named for its “high” position commercially, and may also have been named after Oxford University’s High Street. High street developed more slowly than its neighboring Chapel, Crown, and George streets, but experienced a great period of growth during the mid-19th century. At the turn of the twentieth century, apartment buildings and businesses were established on the street, and the block became increasingly commercialized. The first High Street apartments (the Oxford and Cambridge apartments) were built at the same time as the current Fence House in 1910. Since the early twentieth century, High Street has functioned as a mixed-use neighborhood with both residential and commercial properties. The street was renovated through urban renewal projects in the 1960s. Throughout its long history, the block has been home to an artificial flower manufacturer, restaurants, caterers, coffee shops, lawyers’ and doctors’ offices, barbers, and a funeral home.','2.25','A holdout in the midst of a rapidly changing area, this red-brick house has been home to the Fence Club for some time now.

Fence House is a colonial revival home with much of its original infrastructure intact after a restoration in 1980. The home has 2.5 stories and a basement.

The  home shows signs of both internal and external disrepair since it now functions as a residential and party space for students.

High Street is also dotted with commercial enterprises and eateries, including Olea, an upscale restaurant, Starbucks, Rubamba, and Soul de Cuba. 

The Fence House sits on the corner of High and Crown streets, among many restaurants and bars. High Street feels less Yale-dominated as one moves down the block from Chapel to Crown streets. High Street functions as a social and residential space for Yale students, and according to historian Kirke D. Weaver, the block “survives today as temporary home for a transient student population, who are largely unaware of the history that has preceded them.” However, Crown Street is a nightlife and restaurant spot for New Haven residents as well, allowing for greater connection and exchange between students and city residents.','[\'Touring Chapel, Crown & High\']','[]','[]','Connecticut Historical Commission Building Survey, 15 High Street, 1982.

Initially this venture failed, which perhaps resulted in the delay in construction (12 floors had been finished by 1971, but the building wasn’t completely finished until 1978) and the single tenant (an investment company) in 1980. This failure was attributed to the small size of offices (small for Class A office suites) in the building floor plans and that the south side office windows were obscured by mechanical rooms. Still by 1981 the building was occupied by a few law firms and 15 individual attorneys. By 1999 the building was operating near full capacity with about 50 law offices and 10 LLCs, and by 2006 the building retained fewer law tenants and saw more technology companies and medical consultants take their place. The current tenants are similar to 2006 with the addition of the Chase bank on the north half of the first floor and mezzanine levels.

The building is in the modern style with reflective glass-curtain walls (giving the gold hue) and steel frame, although it is attributed to the post-modern era probably due to the time of construction. There are 15 stories with no 13th floor and instead what should be called the 2nd floor is called the mezzanine level. The bottom two floors have a recessed clear glass façade, which made them conducive to housing Chase bank or other public services.

Since its construction there has been little exterior change—the Lomas and Nettleton entablature and inscriptions into the stone cladding clearly still visible—but has undergone a shift in use and interior structure. Currently it houses the Emily Tremaine Foundation, Home Inc., The Greater New Haven Community Loan Fund and The Institute for Healthcare Communication and, at the back, The Blue Pearl Restaurant. Now part of Olympia Properties portfolio the combined structure is around 20,000 square feet.

In 1894, in the wake of stock exchange collapse termed the \'Panic of 1893\' John E Lomas started a mortgage banking and financial service business, opening its first office at 817 Chapel St, New Haven. In 1900 Lomas joined forces with Edward Lee Nettleton, a childhood friend with whom he had grown up in West Haven. On the 16th July, 1917 the company was incorporated and in 1920 the company moved here—175 Orange St—from their previous offices at 137 Orange St. With this as its headquarters Lomas and Nettleton would grow to become extremely successful, as evidenced in a 1971 New Haven Register article boasting \'Lomas and Nettleton Tops In Nation With $3 Billion Mortgage Portfolio\'.

As Kenneth E. Nettleton, son of Edward Nettleton recounts in his memoir of the company—\'The Story of Lomas and Nettleton\'—the building was "partly new, and partly rebuilt from a two and a half story building on the corner of Orange and Court and a three story building on Court Street." Along with another three story building on Orange St. these properties were purchased from the Osterweis family, renowned for the manufacture of cigars in Connecticut. Prior to this, as the 1911 Sanbon map illustrates, the buildings in question were owned by the Trowbridge family and as a set of images in the Dana Collection suggests, was the site of Goldman\'s Suits up until 1918 when construction work on the new Lomas and Nettleton building began. What\'s more, earlier still than this in 1784, the corner was the residence of Phineas Bradley.

Lomas and Nettleton\'s new location "had a frontage of one hundred feet on Orange St and one hundred feet on Court St". On the first story the building was clad with a moulded cornice of ashlar blocks and above that a stone cut parapet coping. The second story was a stark contrast of brick and simple windows, except for one central window above the entrance with an ornamental surround and cartouche. The entrance itself is arched and flanked by two faux classical columns. The resulting building is Beaux Arts Classical in style and a a fine example of Doric sensibilities. Part of what the 1981 Connecticut Historical Commission inventory form considered "one of the finest groupings of late 19th and early

20th century commercial architecture in the city."

The construction undertaken by Norton and Townsend architects can clearly be seen in the 1924 Sanborn map which demonstrates interior alterations and most evidently the new facade (shown in blue). Moreover, included in the book \'Lomas: The First One Hundred Years\' are two photographs of the de and re-construction of the building, next to a full page directory notice from 1923 with and image of the completed headquarters (which can also be seen in the Dana Collection).

To both Lomas and Nettleton the new headquarters were not, as Kenneth Nettleton\'s memoir recalls, "built for show". Rather, they "signified that years of hard work and constructive effort could have their rewards". A sentiment echoed in the 1921 \'Modern Connecticut Homes and Homecrafts\' published by the American Homecrafts Company, which branded the building "ultra modern" and "a well merited reward for its many years of active and honourable endeavours", finishing by declaring it "an architectural achievement". This notion of the new offices as an understated work built upon a hard working local business is further demonstrated in its referral as an "unimposing building" and "an attractive but unassuming facade" in two New Haven Register articles in 1968 and 1971 respectively.

As I stated earlier, much of the exterior of the building has remained since its construction was completed in 1920. The second story windows have been replaced with large commercial bays, but other than that much of the exterior has remained the same. In 1981, the building underwent a renovation to facilitate its change of use, with First Bank occupying the ground floor offices and a law firm the upper floors. The resulting renovation is noted in the Connecticut Historical Commission inventory form from the same year as one that "greatly improved the quality of the area". This interior refurbishment served to better link up the three separate buildings and subsequently divide it into office and retail units.

The current owners of the property—Olympia Properties—purchased it in 2004 at which time they undertook another minor interior refurbishment, working primarily on the elevator and lobby to the state we see today. After talking to them on the phone they said much of the heavy refurbishment had been done in 1981 and there was little more than cosmetic work for them to do.

Whilst visiting the building to photograph it, I talked with a post man who told me that the architecture firm that was recently located on the first floor used the original vault door as the entrance to their offices. It was this same vault door that Kenneth Nettleton mentions in an anecdote on moving to the new building. He states that "Mrs Lomas was afraid someone would be locked in the vault at night and suffocate", a fear that prompted Mr Lomas to install a signal button.','[]','','1920','[]','[]','Norton and Townsend','','175 Orange St, New Haven, CT','41.3063857','','[\'Business and Commerce east of the Green\']','None');

Murphy was elected in 1932, and he made slum clearance and employment his top priority. Congress passed the Housing Act of 1937, providing the City of New Haven $5.5 million to form the Housing Authority of New Haven in summer of 1938 and start initial projects (Rae). The Housing Authority of New Haven targeted three slum sites in the city, and reached out to David Orr and R.W. Foote Architects to create the complexes (Orr and Foote). The second project targeted a dilapidated block in Mill River on Grand Avenue between Hamilton and Franklin Street. Filled with broken properties and low-income small businesses, the block was home to a very large population of European Immigrants (mostly Irish and Italian) that worked in local factories like the nearby ice plant (Sanborn Maps, 1911/1924). According to the New Haven Register, so many immigrants lived in homes on the block that one at 191 Hamilton St. was known as the “Bee Hive.” &nbsp;The project was named Farnam Courts, and construction was completed in March 1942 (The Old Timer).For the first decade the project was successful, keeping demographics matching the neighborhoods, ensuring families get on their feet, and being a positive icon to the local neighborhood and the city (Rae).</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">However, the newfound stability of the Mill River area was disturbed in the early 1950s. After numerous studies, the Connecticut Department of Transportation proposed an extension of Interstate 91 that would cut through the western section of the Wooster Square. The Wooster Square residents protested the plan and requested an alternative from city hall that would accommodate for displaced families. In the spring of 1950, the City Plan Department of the City of New Haven proposed building I-91 east of Wooster Square Park, arguing slum clearance and downtown access (Weibgen). Members of the Wooster Square community lobbied city officials, and with the support of Italian-American Mayor William C. Celentano, New Haven’s plan gained State support. After a city plan assessment estimated the total cost of the state’s highway plan to be $300,000 more than the city’s, the state adopted the city’s plan in 1953 and construction began in 1956 (Weibgen).</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Although the highway removed blight in the Wooster Square neighborhood, it turned Farnam Courts into a racialized slum. East Wooster Square may have had rundown buildings, but it became a small minority enclave as African-Americans moved into the neighborhood for cheap rents when their industrial wages declined (Weibgen). When the highway displaced this growing African American community, Wooster Square residents insisted that no new public housing should be built around the Square. As a result, many of these families had no choice but to move into Farnam Court, especially when rents began to increase in the 1960s. Farnam Court, within a decade after the highway, became a public housing project of intense black poverty, separated from New Haven jobs and life (Rae; Weibgen)</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">From the 1960s to the 1980s, there are not many public records of structural changes to Farnam Courts (lost or destroyed). In spite of this, it is apparent that The Housing Authority of New Haven was a mediocre landlord. Even as YDN archives describe broken doors, broken windows, cracked stairs, poor heating and leaks, there are no building permits of large renovations (Bates). Moreover, the complex lacked an adequate police presence. The only records available during the time period describe life in the public complex: loud noise, stabbings, robberies, shootings, small fires etc. Farnam Courts has been a hub of drug traffic since the 60s, where everything from weed to heroin exchanges hands. Some residents said they would warn their children to watch out in the snow because one could “see all the syringes on the ground when the snow melts” (Olasky).</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As I explored Farnam Courts for this assignment, I noticed that many issues within the complex have not been resolved. During the afternoon, I observed multiple drug dealings in broad daylight amid languishing young people and a strong aroma marijuana. As I walked towards the northern cluster, I overheard arguments that had the potential to turn violent, and not a single person around me flinched. Some of the surrounding windows were damaged. Moving forward, New Haven has acquired $30 million to tear down and replace Farnam Courts with a Hope IV project. The complex will have 120 housing units instead of 240 townhouse structures, with 70% utilized public housing and 30% at market rate. Additionally, there will be 100 “Farnam Houses” throughout the local neighborhood connected to the Farnam community (Appel).

In the 1990s, the city finally decided to renovate Farnam Courts up to code. In an effort to cut crime in the complex, units were cut from 300 to 240 over the course of two construction phases. Phase I, which started in 1991, provided a new gable roof, a fire alarm system, a new canopy of over the entrance of each building, and repairs to the windows, and renovations to the courtyard. Phase II, which began in 1995, continued the work of Phase I, but also heavily repaired the interior, including drywall, plumbing and heating. Altogether, the renovation cost around $12 million. Alongside the creation of the Livable Cities Initiative in 2005, which reports damaged public property, life drastically improved for the residents in the complex. Still, crime remained an issue. Since the mid-1990s, there has been an increase in violent crimes and shootings at the complex. In 2011, a resident of the complex who shot another resident in 2010, killed a man outside of a bar on the edge of the East Rock neighborhood.

That structure was torn down on April 16, 1913 and replaced soon after with a four story mixed use brick building constructed by Hubbell and Merwin. In the first half of the twentieth century the building housed a bakery, stationer, paint company, the Connecticut Savings Bank of New Haven, several lawyers and unions. An article in 1946 found in the Dana Collection reports the sale of the building from the Grand Lodge of the Ancient Order of United Workmen of North Dakota to the newly formed 207 Orange Realty Company, headed by Robert L. Sykes of Sykes and Libby Jewelry. Tenants listed at that time included chapters of the United Steel Workers, United Mine Workers, International Ladies’ Garment Union, War Relief Committee, and the United Rubber Workers of America, the abundance of unions likely due to the building’s proximity to city hall.

The building was not part of the State Street Redevelopment and Renewal Area. Price &amp; Lee directories report prolonged periods of vacancy in much of the building and high turnover of tenants. Storefronts were removed, a new façade was added, and the entrance was moved to the corner of the building between 1951 and 1973, as revealed in Sanborn maps, and the neighboring buildings were replaced with parking. A bank was later constructed on one of the neighboring lots, 245 Orange St, but now sits vacant.

The building’s most recent occupant is The Connection, Inc., a human services and development agency, which arrived in the past two years.','[]','','1913','[\'Downtown\']','[]','Hubbell & Merwin','','205 Orange St, New Haven, CT','41.3068038','','[\'Business and Commerce east of the Green\']','None');

Behind the window bays of the building’s four-stories has occurred a diverse and unique mix of advertising, manufacturing, government, retail, wholesale, and even legal and illegal activities. 51-53 Elm Street, beyond being a gorgeous example of a unique architectural style, represents a strong cross-section of downtown New Haven’s tumultuous economic and mercantile history.  </span></p>','[]','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Built around 1875 by an unknown architect for an unknown client, the building is of cut-stone-and-brick construction, large overhanging cornice and hairline incised ornamentation that classify it as a progeny of the Queen Anne style of Victorian architecture. The Eastlake style distinguishes itself by its geometric details and pure lines, designed to be affordable and easy to clean. 51-53 Elm is a beautiful showcase of this style; its horizontal bands sweep the eye around the corner, streamlining the 4×8 bay, four-story-high structure into a seamless continuation of the city block it occupies. Furthermore, the building is stylistically in conversation with its neighbor the Imperial Granum Building at 47 Elm Street, the only cast-iron face in New Haven. While visually similar to 51–53, the latter building’s windows are larger (a luxury afforded by iron’s superior structural strength compared to brick and stone), and the facade details more ornate, diverging from the Eastlake style of its next-door neighbor.</span></p>','c.1875','[\'Downtown\']','[\'Brick\', \'Stone\']','unknown','<p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">1881: Harlan Hubbard’s Advertising Agency</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">1882: International News Agency, H.

Its sharp, solid design, in dialogue with the cast-iron facade of 47 Elm and the street corner, seems to assert with confidence that the simple, ineffaceable truths of a simpler world from years past are still true today. Its facade and interior were renovated in 1960, but the building that exists today is quasi identical to the building that first stood in 1875; throughout the years, 51–53 Elm has stayed true to itself, and in doing so has become a landmark of New Haven’s urban landscape. Beyond merely marking the past, however, the building can be identified as an example of the success of preservation and be used as a model for further preservation of the many historic architectural gems abounding in downtown New Haven. </span></p>','[\'Grand Avenue: Gateway to Fair Haven\']','[\'Commercial\', \'Institutional\']','[]','None','<p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Connecticut Historical Commission Building Survey, 1982.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Dana Archives, book 24, pg.55C.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">New Haven City Directories, 1875–1993.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Brown’s History of Urban Design of New Haven, pg.116.</span></p>');

The building has a two-story added facade in wood and plasterwork. The original building was clearly a nondescript commercial building, but its facade features an oddly tall arch with windows to fill it. The first record of 844 grand avenue can be found on the 1879 Bailey map of New Haven. The earliest tenant found was one Edward Haesche, a second-hand furniture maker, who went on to work for J.C. Peck and Son, a much larger furniture manufacturer and seller. Haesche had possession of the building from 1884 to 1887, when it passed out of his hands. The next recorded owner was Isidore Opper, who opened up an obviously successful furniture store in the space: Opper had possession of the building from 1897 to 1923, during which time he made two changes to the building: by 1911 he made a small addition to the rear of the building, and by 1923 Opper had extended the front of the building slightly, resulting in today\'s rather incongruous façade with its disproportionate arch. It is likely that he also added the building\'s  From 1924 to 1932 the space was  occupied by the Automatic Music Store, and from 1932-1935 by Lena Rodofsky, another furniture retailer, and these tenants saw out the worst of the Depression. After spending 1936 vacant, the building was bought by the Boston Specialty company,  a furniture company, in 1937. Boston Specialty Company maintained possession until 1949, and the building sat vacant from 1950 to 1953, when it was acquired by the Marcus Furniture Company. In 1970, the Academy furniture company acquired the building and kept it until 1977, when it was acquired by Credit Furniture. Credit Furniture lost possession of the building in 1980, and it sat vacant until 1984, when Klein and Jay developers acquired it as part of a plan to revitalize Grand Avenue. Klein and Jay leased the building to the Marst Corporation for the year 1988, then used the building as their own headquarters from 1988 to 1990. During this time 844 Grand has a number of listed sublettors, suggesting that Klein and Jay subdivided the property into a number of retail and commercial spaces. By 1993 all the units of 844 stood vacant, and in 1994 Wilhelm Gertz bought the building and opened Wilhelm Gertz Pianos, which stayed open until his death in 2006. In 2007 his estate sold 844 Grand to the New Haven Centers of Light, who remain its sole owners and occupants today.

According to the 1981 report done by the Connecticut Historical Society, 271 Crown was built for James M. Mason and his family. The 1888 Sanborn map of New Haven reflects his residency there (Figure 1). Mason owned a clothing store at 446 Chapel Street and was also the Clerk of the New Haven School District.

Built as a three-story, load-bearing masonry structure with a shallow flat roof and cupola, broad projecting roofline with modillion cornice and denticular molding supported by corner consoles, the building reflects the popular Italianate architectural style of the time period (1850s-1870s). The front façade is five bays wide with regularly spaced window openings with sandstone lintel and sill. The second story front has a circular window which was not original.The first floor storefront is a 1965 addition with a standing-seas metal roof over two large display days and center entry porch.

The building belonged to James M. Mason until the 1911 Sanborn map reflects the dwelling belonged to a C.A.F. Phizen Meyer (Figure 3). In 1913, the building belonged to Nathan Cohen. The building was home to the Book &amp; Gavel Club in the early twentieth century, a society of the Yale Law School. The New Haven directories in 1914-1915 display the residential building as vacant until its most prominent resident, Yale D. Bishop, moved into the home in 1916. Yale D. Bishop according to the New Haven directories (Figure 4), was an insurance adjuster and proprietor at The Colonnade restaurant in West Haven. Additionally, he was the owner of Hotel Bishop in 1074 Chapel Street.

Bishop occupied 271 Crown from 1916 until 1949, a time period during which reflects a significant changing dynamic on Crown Street. When 271 Crown was originally built in 1865, the Sanborn maps displayed a highly residential neighborhood occupying Crown Street. However, the 1923 Sanborn Map with paste-overs until 1930 (Figure 5) shows how buildings along Crown were increasingly becoming commercial and the building to the right of 271 Crown was torn down and converted into a gas station.

In 1949 Yale D. Bishop presumably passes away as the directory from that year shows a conversion of the originally single occupant home, to holding multiple residents. Among the residents listed is a Mrs. Bishop, presumably widowed and taking on boarders. In 1965, 271 Crown is back to having a single owner/resident listed as Paul Covington. With this change, the original entry porch was replaced by a storefront addition. The addition of the storefront to the building clearly demonstrates the impact of Crown Street’s conversion from a residential street to a commercial and retail street. 271 Crown manages to adapt to this change in dynamic through the first floor conversion into a storefront with apartment units in the second and third floors.

In 1969 the China Trading Company occupied the first floor storefront and stayed there until 1999. Owned by Grace C. and You Dong Hom, 271 Crown not only has converted into a commercial/residential building, but it also reflects the changing demographic of the area.  In 1981 the CT Historical Commission reported the primary threat to building as renewal, and deterioration of neighborhood.

In 2003 271 Crown became home to the Chai Society, a Yale members only Jewish club maintaining the first floor storefront and upper floor apartment units. 2007 marks the year Geronimo Tequila Bar &amp; Restaurant moved into the first floor store front and expanded the storefront into a raised outdoor dining/bar patio that abuts the sidewalk. Geronimo is a widely popular restaurant in New Haven attracting a primarily Yale associated, young crowd. The upper floors continue to be rented out as multiple apartment units.

Overall, 271 Crown has remained largely the same structure but its adaptations to function reflect its change in surrounding urban landscape from residential to commercial/retail.','[]','','1865','[\'Crown Street\']','[]','unknown','','271 Crown Street, New Haven, CT 06511','41.3067','','[\'Heading down Crown Street\']','None','[]','[]');

However, the next map which spans from 1923-30 shows that this gap was filled during this period. The 1930 business directory lists four occupants under this address. This list includes The Spencer Hotel, Whitemen’s Furnishings, the Terminal taxi company, and a man named Nathan Kirschner. Kirschner is listed as a baker in the street index. However, his personal entry towards the beginning of the directory lists him as a barber. Unfortunately, Kirschner died shortly after moving into the building in 1930 so he is not listed in any other New Haven directory. Thus, his true profession can only be speculated about.

There are some indicators in later directories about what the first floor could have been used for in the 1930s. The Spencer Hotel occupied the building’s third floor for the decade. The 1938 directory shows that Alexander Clothing is the second floor tenant. This allows the other building tenants to be placed to their respective floors, without the information being explicitly provided in the directories. It can thus be gathered that Kirschner operated his business out of the building’s first floor. This storefront would remain vacant until 1935 when Rink the Tavern would move into the space. Rink the Tavern would later make way for The Anchor Spa, a bar despite its name, in 1939 when Albert Levett bought the storefront.

The timing of the addition behind 272 College Street, by 1930, could suggest that Kirschner was the person who oversaw the project. One can hypothesize that Kirschner built the space to house a kitchen for his storefront. This hypothesis carries weight for two reasons. The first is that the directory shows that Kirschner was either a barber or a baker; the latter would no doubt require some sort of kitchen space. The second reason is that next two tenants were a tavern and a bar, both of which served food. This could have also been the point at which the first floor was expanded to abut 268 College Street, leaving the second and third floors still separate.

The 1939 directory lists AM Levett Rest as a new tenant of the building. Levett moved his bar, the Anchor Spa, from its original home in Milford, to 272 College Street. This bar helped to populate a bar district which arose during the post-prohibition era. During this time, the façade came to resemble its current iteration. One difference however was that the sign, which became synonymous with the Anchor, was not present. Rather, “Anchor Spa” was painted directly onto the blue, art modern façade.

The Lincoln House Hotel came to occupy part of the building during the 1950s. In 1963, Marshall Moore bought the Anchor Spa. The Moores ran the Anchor from 1963 until January 2015. During this time they would replace the Anchor Spa sign, with the spectacular, three-dimensional ”Anchor Restaurant” sign. The Anchor played host to a hip crowd during its early days. Celebrities were known to visit the speakeasy style “Mermaid Room” in the basement. The bar poured classic drinks. During the 80s and 90s however, the bar became somewhat of a dive; though patrons could still enjoy a classic martini. The bar was adorned with red, circular booths and an old fashioned jukebox. In 2014, the Anchor was listed as one of Esquire Magazine’s best bars in America.

The Anchor closed its doors on January 4th, 2015 after failing to keep up with rent payments. The iconic sign was taken down shortly after the bar’s closing. It currently is in possession of the Moore Family. The Anchor is set to reopen later this year under Karl Franz Williams, a mixologist. Williams, Yale class of 1997, also runs the bar 67 Orange Street in Harlem. Williams hopes to revitalize the bar while connecting with its roots.

Yale University Properties is the current owner of the building. The second and third floors are part of the Townsend Apartment building, which extends over the 1000 Chapel Street Property.','','[\'Commercial\', \'Residential\']','[]','[]','[]','272 College Street’s origins are somewhat unclear given that the building itself seems to be an addition to the corner building at 1000 Chapel Street. Though 272 College abuts 1000 Chapel, the two buildings differ in dimension. 272 College is set back roughly a foot further from the street. In addition, 1000 Chapel rises four stories while 272 College stands only three stories tall. Both buildings have identical architectural styles above their first floor facades. Nonetheless, the historical records do not seem to provide the necessary information to determine whether the buildings were both constructed in 1830, or if the addition was added on in 1859, when Sanborn maps of New Haven begin to show the addition.

The 1911 Atlas shows that the Townsend Company owed both 272 College and 1000 Chapel Street. This atlas makes it clear that there was a defined gap between 272 College and the building next door, now The Owl Shop. Though the gap has since been sealed on the street level, it remains between the buildings’ second and third stories, leading to speculation about the building’s somewhat cloudy history.','','','[]','','1830-1859','[\'Downtown\', \'Town Green\']','[]','','','272 College Street, New Haven, CT 06510','41.3071482','','[\'Touring Chapel, Crown & High\']','[]','[]','"Alumnus Karl Franz Williams to Raise Anchor Once Again (the Bar, That Is)."

Grocers and Pentecostal Church','[]','','','','[]','[]','[]','[]','','','777-785 Grand Avenue encompasses two buildings. Both appear to have been built in 1890, appearing in the 1901 Sanborn map. Before the constructions of the buildings, the land was seized by the bank due to a foreclosure (White). The buildings are a late adaptation of an Italianate style of the Victorian architectural era, a typical style of commercial buildings during that time featuring a brick exterior and masonry frame. Currently, 783-785 Grand Ave has the distinct feature of seemingly missing a window. Furthermore, the façade seems to be newer compared to the brickwork of the building next door. Records do not show if the building originally had the missing window or not. In 1988, a permit was filed to completely remodel the second floor apartment and to apply the egress window requirements (Building permit application, 1988).  This could have resulted in filling in a window that was once there before. For a long time, the area was a bustling commercial strips filled with various shops along both sides as shown through a photograph in the Dana Photo Collection. Throughout the years, numerous shopkeepers went in and out of these doors.  Today, however, the street is quieter with less businesses and patrons. 777-781 Grand Ave. In 1889, Andrew J. Clerkin and William H. McDonald bought the building from the New Haven Savings Bank (White Brothers &amp; Clark, Hall &amp; Peck, 1931). They were the first business to enter 779 - 781 as Clerkin &amp; McDonald, owned and operated by Clerkin and McDonald themselves. Beforehand moving to this location, Clerkin &amp; McDonald had been located down the street at 738 Grand Ave.  Here, they sold stove ranges, plumbing services, steam and hot water heaters. The 1901 Sanborn maps reveal that there used to be a tin shop in the back where Clerkin and McDonald most likely made and repaired their products. In 1903, William McDonald decided to branch out and opened his own store, which interestingly offered the same service right across the street at 778 Grand Ave. In the same year, Clerkin sold the property to Reverend John Russell, who worked at St. Patrick’s Church right down the street. Russell then leased the storefront to Clerkin and the upstairs to another group known as the Franklin Athletic Club. After the split with his partner, Clerkin then changed the store name to Clerkin &amp; Company (New Haven City Directory 1903). Clerkin, with the help of his sons, remained in business until 1934. In 1914, the store was split into two, with Ferdinand Gentile Barbershop occupying the other half.  When Clerkin went out of business, the storefront became vacant for a year before being picked up by J J Vollono Radios. However, it was again short lived and after a year, in 1937, Vincenzo D’Addio Shoe Repair replaced it. In the next year, Gentile, the barber, also left the building.  A restaurant took its place for five years. In 1946, Bob’s Market took over both of the spaces, returning it to one storefront, as was the original plan. He stayed there for a decade before Lazio Importer Co Grocers, owned by Louis Persichilli and Joseph Fratarcangelli, succeeded the store.  The successor was again short-lived, only lasted two years. However, the next time the store exchanged hands, its purpose remained the same while its name changed to Italia Importing Co. Grocers in a turnover to Italio and John Ciocca. In 1971, ownership exchanged hands again to Pasquale DelMonaco. In 1977, the space was finally acquired by Achille DiVirgillo, and he retains ownership until today (appraisal). In 1983, he changed the store name to Vinny’s Italia Importing Co and later on, he decided that he wasn’t satisfied with the spelling and changed it to Vinnie’s Italia Importing Co. Today, the store is still surviving, serving a steady flow of customers and local regulars. Upstairs is a different story.  Franklin Athletic Club stayed active until 1932 for 19 years. After that, listings disappeared until 1950 when Lega Abruzzese, an Italian social association, took up the place again. After five years, Club Champlain Inc. replaced the association. Unfortunately, Champlain only lasted two years. Departing away from a club meeting area, the second story of the building turned into a Laundromat for a year and then became vacant. In 1968, it turned back to its roots when the Universal Italian Association took over for two years. In 1974, the Little Italy Club occupied the place. After three years, it became vacant again until 1990 when Connecticut Aikikai Akikido &amp; Iaido Karate Studio came in. And unlike its many predecessors, the studio has strongly stayed in business until this day, 23 years and counting. 783-785 Grand Ave. On August 8th, 1889, The New Haven Savings Bank sold the title deed to John F. Shanley. There, John Shanley opened a Boston Store in 1890 and then dry goods store in 1904 in 785 Grand Ave. The store stayed until the end of 1922 when he died due to an accident on the interstate. The building title was then passed to Morris Cohen for $20,500. Morris Cohen then leased 785 Grand Ave in 1923 to Louis Quint, a milliner. There, Morris Cohen made his business in designing and manufacturing hats. Like its friend next door, 783-785 also went through many changes of hands, each hoping to construct a successful business.  However, regardless of success, many businesses still disappeared within a few years.  After some rocky times, the storefront of the building served as a grocer for an extended amount of time, though under a handful of different owners. First was Harry Science Grocers and then it became David Haber Grocers. Next up was David Morris Food, which was owned by David Fleischner and Morris Rubin. However, the turnover streak ran dry and the lot stood vacant for two years. In 1953, a coppersmith by the name of Alex Frank took up the place but for one reason or another left it vacant. In 1957, four phrenologists with the same last name came in and left by the next year. After being vacant again for a year, Half Hour Laundry took over for only another two years. Seizing the opportunity, a long time furniture store from across the street (778 Grand Ave) took over and stayed for two years as well. Standard Window Shade Co. was the first business that stayed for more than two years besides the grocers. In fact, the owner, Ralph Colavolpe was able to keep it up for fourteen years, ending the business in 1979. Around two decades later, Cheryl Elliot, now the owner of the building, opened Nicki and Joey’s New York Style Deli and then changed it to Nicki and Joey’s Soul Food grocery store the following year. However, a year later she closed the grocery. Her husband, Joe Elliot, filed a permit to renovate the deli space to create a Laundromat. However, no Laundromat has been documented. They hung onto the space until 1996 and for a while, no new businesses moved in. In the early 2000s, a Spanish Pentecostal church finally claimed the lot and has been there ever since. Unlike the clubroom next door, the upstairs of this building was used as a living unit, many of which stayed for a long time, static, in contrast the fast-changing businesses downstairs.  Numerous shopkeepers went in and out of these building since the grand opening. Taken the history of these two stores as a whole, one can see a storefront that is both diverse and colorful, going from being a grocers and plumbers to Laundromat to a church. Despite some of the businesses disappearing quickly, the buildings held its steady stream of new comers. Even during the Great Depression, the storefront was never left empty for more than an extended amount of time. However, as time went by and with the urban scape changing, the bustling of various shops moving in and out died down. The declining from its prime could be due to the construction of Interstate-91 which passes by within a block away (see Google Map figure). And today, many of the surrounding buildings were demolished but the two buildings still remain and sit quietly among the empty lots and parking spaces.

Work commenced in 1928.  New Haven architect Dwight Smith assisted with the project.  Estimated cost:  $850,000 - $900,000.   Second largest building of its kind ever constructed in Connecticut.  

The building is set at an angle on the lot.  Three- and four-story U-shaped "head house" facing Goffe Street.  Wings extend down Hudson and County Streets.  

In their book on Connecticut Armories, Rossano and Donohue call the building a "streamlined Military Romanesque style," referring to the arcaded brick corbel tables that give a medieval fort-like quality to the structure.  Roofline of "head house" defined by limestone parapet and the words "State Armory" mark the central pavilion.  
 
"Balanced and (seemingly symmetrical, the Goffe Street façade consisted of five alternately projecting and recessed blocks, with tall, narrow window openings framed by lintels of soldier course bricks and molded concrete sills.  The entire structure rested on a raised foundation composed of smooth ashlar brownstone blocks." (Built to Serve, p. 126).  ','An empty landmark on Goffe Street facing a public park.

Anchoring the corner of Chapel and York Streets, the building is modern insofar as it is ahistorical, and utterly uninterested in making you comfortable—the pillars’ edges are jagged. Some thought the A&amp;A daring, others brutal.

Loria Center. Known as the Art and Architecture Building when it was built in 1963, Rudolph Hall is all hammered concrete and rough edges. Its brutalist style contrasts beautifully with Louis Kahn’s Yale University Art Gallery and British Art Museum, which round out the intersection. The Loria Center, designed by Gwathmey Siegel &amp; Associates, adds a postmodern feel to the area.&nbsp;</p>','<p>This nine-story brutalist building, with its exposed concrete and rugged edges, is clearly distinguishable from the rest of Yale University’s campus. The building’s large windows frame the seven visible stories, and allow passersby to peer inside the building. From the outside, the studios, classrooms, staircases and library can be seen through glass flanked by thick concrete towers. The contrast between the left and right side of the complex can be seen in the difference in form and material (1). The expansion, constructed in 2008 according to Gwathmey’s designs, is covered in limestone and zinc panels (2). They complement the ragged concrete, now half a century old, dressing Rudolph Hall. Dividing these two structures is a vertical stretch of glass windows. To its left, snuggled between two concrete pillars, is Rudolph Hall’s grand entrance staircase. It encourages you to ascend, to step off the sidewalk, to lose yourself within the building.&nbsp;</p>','<p>This building is located in the corner of the intersection of York and Chapel Street.&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding area consists of other Yale buildings, like the University Art Gallery, the Repertory Theater, and Jonathan Edwards College. It is also surrounded by non-Yale buildings, which house Book Trader Café, Anaya Sushi, Insomnia Cookies, and The Juice Box. With its museums and eateries, the neighborhood is centered around leisure and entertainment. Street lamps on Chapel Street illuminate the area at dusk, giving it a peaceful feel.

By 1924, the building sported further brick additions, and housed the Collegiate Preparatory School. Behind it, Duncan Hall had become the Duncan Hotel, with Eldorado Apartments filling in the space between the properties. Yale, meanwhile, was in the middle of redeveloping its landholdings: Harkness Memorial Quadrangle now took up the entire block defined by Elm, High, York, and Library Walk, while other university property—the future Jonathan Edwards College—was under construction closer to Chapel Street. Private retail still held its own on Chapel itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>By the time the Art and Architecture Building was completed in 1963, however, the north side of Chapel from High to York had been completely conquered by the university. Street Hall, the Yale University Art Gallery, and Louis Kahn’s Art Gallery addition constituted a row of collegiate arts completed by the A&amp;A’s rough concrete form.&nbsp;</p>','150\' x 145\'','<p>The Art and Architecture building was designed by Paul Rudolph, then chair of the Yale’s Architecture department. The brutalist style he envisioned for the building differed considerably from Louis Kahn’s Yale University Art Gallery, located just across York Street (7). The gallery’s trim curtains of glass seem feeble compared to the solid concrete walls of the A&amp;A. This division of styles—exacerbated by the Collegiate Gothic Jonathan Edwards College next to the gallery—strains the unity of this portion of Yale’s campus. Whether the area feels chaotic or vibrant is up to the viewer.&nbsp;</p><p>Many, many complications arose within Rudolph’s structure as the years went on. The spaces designated for sculptors and painters (in the subbasement and on the top floor, respectively) lacked the quality of the architects’ studios. For instance, the subbasement’s low ceilings forced the sculptors to construct their works in pieces, carry each piece up the stairs, then assemble them elsewhere in the building. The artists’ studio spaces, meanwhile, felt tiny, with the ragged concrete walls constantly closing in (8). The use of space also seemed inconsistent: some areas, like the library, evoked depth and light; others, like Hastings Hall in the basement, felt like a tomb (9). Many who used the building despised it, at least initially.</p><p>In 1969, a fire damaged the upper floors of the building. Firefighters flooded the lower levels while trying to control the blaze. Interior and exterior alterations followed, compromising Rudolph’s original vision for the structure. Windows were boarded up, and additional levels were added to the building. (10). Under Rudolph’s successor, the postmodernist Charles Moore, maintenance of the oft-hated building lagged. Combined with fire safety violations, this neglect necessitated an expensive, thorough restoration.&nbsp;</p><p>Dean Robert A. M. Stern spearheaded the building’s renovation, hiring Gwathmey Siegel &amp; Associates to not only restore its interior but to also construct an adjoining building, the Loria Center for the History of Art (11). The main problem Gwathmey faced was creating fluidity between the two structures, a puzzle that was only partly solved. Still, the restoration and expansion illustrated Gwathmey’s devotion to the building’s gray exterior and massive windows.

Between 2003-2005, Yale School of Architecture professor Kent Bloomer played a key role in the Clinton Avenue School\'s renovation. He designed the school\'s iconic green iron archway which sits above the masonry of the school\'s front entrance (Kent Bloomer Studios, "Truman and Clinton Schools," New Haven).</p>','<p>A recently renovated three story neoclassical school, made of stone and brick with noticeable deterioration that\'s visible upon a closer look.

The back façade’s Ionic columns are a beautiful detail and break up an otherwise seemingly homogenous set of building materials, primarily composed of brick and stone. The school currently serves children in Kindergarten through the 8th Grade.</p>','<p>The local architectural firm of Brown and Von Beren built the Clinton Avenue School in 1911. Brown and Von Beren built the Clinton Avenue School, along with three other schools, including the Strong School in 1915, the Atwater Training School, in 1918, and Fair Haven Junior High School in 1928 in response to Fair Haven\'s growing population (3 and 5). Fair Haven\'s growing population matched the neighborhood\'s expansion and changing economy. In the mid-nineteenth century, Fair Haven rapidly transformed from a naval commercial economy based on importing and exporting oysters from the nearby Quinnipiac River, to a manufacturing economy (6). Companies like the National Folding Box Company were founded in 1891 and began to employ thousands of people (7).</p><p>The advent of the horse railway allowed Fair Haven to become one of the city\'s first streetcar suburbs (8). By 1910, Fair Haven grew to a population of 20,000 (9).</p><p>Between 1910 and 1945, industry continued to expand and attracted Irish, Italian, and Polish immigrants to the community (7). Unfortunately, external forces would soon place Fair Haven\'s prosperity in peril. In 1937, the Home Owners\' Loan Corporation yellow-lined the neighborhood due to its older, declining infrastructure (10). The HOLC\'s decision to provide Fair Haven with the second lowest rating for loans was most likely also due to the fact that many residents were working-class, Irish, Polish, and Italian immigrants. Ethnic and racial prejudice influenced many of the HOLC\'s ratings, as it regularly red lined African-American neighborhoods throughout New Haven and the nation, effectively hindering African-Americans\' ability to purchase suburban homes. Unfortunately, Fair Haven\'s prosperity and expansion were fleeting, as deindustrialization and middle-class flight began to afflict the community between 1945 and 1970 (5). Moreover, New Haven began to experience urban renewal, and these efforts destroyed nearby neighborhoods like Wooster Square and attracted displaced, low-income residents to Fair Haven because of its close proximity to their former homes (11). Although seemingly trivial, the HOLC\'s rating system more than likely predisposed Fair Haven towards a cycle of blight, deindustrialization, and loss of middle-class residents, thus weakening the neighborhood\'s tax base.</p><p>As New Haven continued to suffer from deindustrialization, urban decline, and middle-class flight throughout the latter third of the twentieth century, the Clinton Avenue School responded with necessary social services. Former Clinton Avenue School principal John F. Leary responded to the Quinnipiac Terrace Housing projects\' increasing occupancy with a willingness to offer the residents\' children enrollment at the school (12).</p><p>At the same time that Fair Haven was declining, a new population began to call the neighborhood home. By the 1960s, Latinos began to move to Fair Haven in large numbers. Affordable rents helped Latino merchants to establish businesses, including Crazy Chicken Barbeque and La Casa Green, which have since closed (13).</p><p>Over the years, the Clinton Avenue School\'s student population has changed to reflect the community\'s changing racial demographics. As of the 2016-2017 academic year, the Clinton Avenue School serves 577 students, grades K-8 and employs approximately 42 teachers, with 441 students receiving free or reduced lunch. 422 students are Latino, 102 students are Black, 47 students are White, 3 students are Asian, and 3 students identify as 2 or More Races (14). The school\'s curriculum has also adapted in response to changing demographics, as the school experiments with various types of bilingual education to meet its students’ needs (15).</p><p><br></p>','Brown and Von Beren ');

The apartments were a response to demands at the end of the 19th century for students in Cambridge, MA and New Haven interested in living \'off campus\' outside of the Universities\' residential colleges. &nbsp;Equipped with the finest of modernized amenities for the day, the original building included a restaurant, elevator, telephones and a barber shop. The apartments, originally listed for Yale Students and families, were converted into a hotel in the early 20th century when Yale University began to enforce a residency requirement that all students live on campus. &nbsp;The building thus became a precedent design for the \'multiple occupancy structure\' which would eventually become the norm for typical modern hotels and apartments.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>','<p>Built by Henry A. Warner, the apartments were situated on a plot of land known as \'The Warner Block\' located between College and York Streets along Chapel St, directly across from Yale University\'s Old Campus. &nbsp;Originally the block was owned by New Haven manufacturing tycoon, Gaius F. Warner, who\'s erected a mansion and planted the remainder of the plot with trees and ornamental shrubs. &nbsp;As Chapel Street continued to grow into a major retail and pedestrian thoroughfare outlining the Yale campus, Henry Warner saw the potential for substantial profit in developing the family\'s block, and erected the student apartments adjacent to his father\'s mansion. &nbsp;After his father\'s death, the mansion would eventually be purchased by the Union League around the turn of the century, who would reconstruct the front facade, extending it towards Chapel street to be in line with the front facade of the student apartments, thus creating Sherman\'s Alley.&nbsp;</p>','<p>The building\'s first two stories are fused to neighboring 1056 Chapel Street (housing the architecture studios of Pelli Clarke Pelli). &nbsp;Sherman\'s Alley separates the building from the neighboring Union League Cafe, which originally served as the house of Henry A. Warner\'s father, Gaius F. Warner (founder of G. F. Warner &amp; Co. Manufacturing, one of the largest manufacturing companies in New Haven at the turn of the century). &nbsp;The building is located on a section of Historic Chapel Street in which the sidewalk is paved with slate, while brick is used to pave Sherman\'s Alley. &nbsp;Behind a wooden sign suspended over the alley entrance on which is inscribed "Specialty Shops Sherman\'s Alley" with characteristic gold filled engraving, lights are strung between the adjacent Union League Cafe and the second floor of 1044 Chapel as an attempt to further beautify the outdoor space. &nbsp;Most recently in October 2016, work was begun to extend the brick pathway of Sherman\'s Alley into the Crown Street parking lot, allowing for further landscaping and curation of the alley and its rear approach. &nbsp;Parking is located behind the building\'s annex and can be accessed by foot through Sherman\'s Alley or by car off of Crown Street.</p>','<p>Slender Queen Anne style apartment building with first floor retail entered off of Chapel Street, as well as adjacent Sherman\'s Alley. &nbsp;Two columns of wooden bay windows extrude from the cut stone facade on both Chapel Street and Sherman\'s Alley from the second through the fifth floors. Each floor of bays is uniquely accented, capped on Chapel Street by two covered open air balconies on the fifth floor. &nbsp;An iron fire escape is framed by the bay windows onto Sherman\'s Alley. &nbsp;Apartments located in an extended 3 story annex behind the building extend into a parking lot entered off of Crown Street. &nbsp;Since purchased by the \'Shops at Yale\', the first floor retail facing Chapel Street has undergone significant renovation to restore original storefront glazing/paneling in keeping with the buildling\'s Queen Anne style and detailing. &nbsp;Currently, the building is fully occupied and storefront retail on Chapel St is thriving. &nbsp;Empty retail off of Sherman\'s Alley is undergoing restoration, though recently some of the antique glazing was vandalized. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The condition of the building interior is dated but fair. &nbsp;The original Chapel Street entrance to the apartment lobby and grand staircase has been cut off to allow for maximum retail square footage along Chapel Street. &nbsp;Thus, apartments are entered off of Sherman\'s Alley. &nbsp;Demising walls have been added to remodel individual apartments in the main building, and a number of fire doors have been successively installed at entrances to the original building staircase. &nbsp;The building\'s elevator is located in its original core, complete with the original iron floor indicator dial above the threshold on the first floor. &nbsp;Original wood flooring can be found in a handful of apartments in the main building, while most apartments including all those in the annex are carpeted. &nbsp;The three story annex currently contains two story two bedroom units, whereas the main building contains single floor units and loft style units on the sixth floor. &nbsp;Whereas the three story annex and six story main building were both built in 1892 and successively converted into use as multifamily apartments and later a hotel, the annex originally connected to the main building on the second and third floors through social rooms such as the \'billiard room\' and \'parlor\'. &nbsp;These rooms would later be re-purposed as apartments in the latest renovation of the building, thus limiting the connection of the main building and annex to a corridor on the second floor. &nbsp;The the annex currently benefits from central heating and air, while the main building still uses its original steam radiator system and does not provide AC.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>','<p>Connecticut Historical Commission (Historic Resources Inventory)</p><p>Dana Scrapbook (Vol. I)</p><p>Sanborn Map Co.

The late 19<sup>th</sup>Century saw to a number of impressively sized private residences in the blocks adjacent to the site of 71-73 Elm Street; the addresses were also numbered differently. The plot of land where 71-73 Elm Street currently resides appears to have previously been 37 Elm Street, as well as some of the adjacent lot. 37 Elm Street was the property of Irving G. Richey, in what seems to have been a private home. The building appears to have been narrow—much smaller than the building on the Eli Whitney property next door—and with an outbuilding to the back left of the main structure. By 1916, addresses and property lines on the block had changed, and the current structure had been built. Four steel beams embedded within the ceiling reveal an intention to build a second story. From the onset, the building of 71-73 Elm Street took up almost the entirety of the plot of land—this was with the exception of the small backyard-formed courtyard by the walls of the 59 Elm Street building that surround it from the back and side. The building also had, from its original construction, the prominent wire glass square skylights near the back. The free-standing wall was also part of the original construction. Changes were made when Hallock F. Co. went out of business between 1926 and 1928, and when Mihran H. Kebabian bought the site. The original partitioning wall was taken down by 1931. In the mid-to-late 20<sup>th</sup>Century, the backyard courtyard was turned into an interior space. In the 1970s, John Kebabian added security shutters for the front windows to protect from the then-important threat of break-ins. It was also sometime in the later 20<sup>th</sup>Century that the roof was rubberized, to make for a better walking surface when rugs were being left there to dry and to protect from water seeping into the building itself. This was also around the time that the HVAC system was installed (which is visible from the roof).&nbsp;</p><p>Besides some of these technological changes to the site in the 20<sup>th</sup>Century, the site has very much remained almost very similar to when the Kebabian’s first purchased it around 1920.&nbsp;</p>','<p>New Haven Museum&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sanborn Maps of 1911 and 1923-1931</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Directories from 1889 to 1935&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: black;">The Greater New Haven Directory "New Haven: The Price and Lee Company," [Year]</span></p><p><br></p><p>John P.

Rohr, March 26<sup>th</sup>1925. Courtesy of John P. Kebabian’s Personal Archives.&nbsp;</p>','<p>Kebabian’s is a flat-roofed, single-story brick structure that stands out for its strong horizontal lines and the garnet-red paint on its long sidewall and façade. The long side wall, which also advertises the age of Kebabian’s Rug Store in white paint, has undergone no structural renovations since the original construction. The retro-style “Kebabian’s Rug Store” sign, which originally was lit with neon lights, is estimated to have been installed on the top left corner of the building in the 1940s. Two simple, brick pilasters frame the large window expanses, with heavy brackets that support a thick cornice. These neoclassical elements, painted with the same red color of the brick wall, combine subtle flourishes to a more contemporary, monochrome exterior.</p><p><br></p><p>The entrance to the building is symmetrical from center, with its glass and steel double doors recessed from the street by about 5 feet. The floor plan in front of the double doors is trapezoidal, with the longer end facing the street—this has the effect of funneling customers off the sidewalk and into the narrower entryway. The exterior flooring is marked by its bright green turf, elevated four inches off of the sidewalk.&nbsp;&nbsp;Between 1925 and 1932, the building was separated into two different commercial areas—the wall that partitioned the two spaces was taken down by Mihran Haig Kebabian, but can still be seen in segments in the basement.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The main floor of the rug store is divided into three spaces: the largest is the showroom. It is followed by two small open-office cubicles that are backed with a partitioning wall. The walls of the showroom are covered in two different kinds of boards—beam board and peg board. The beam board was part of the original interior design—the peg board was added by John Kebabian in the 1950s, who saw promise in the commercial rug industry and used peg boards to present samples of the then-popular carpeting. Beyond the floor to ceiling wall partition, which is cut open to allow for a large walkway on the left-hand side of the store, is a work area. Two large, square skylights bring light onto the two office areas. Originally, these skylights had been finished with wired glass—now, they have a tinted, glass that forms as a bulb when seen from the roof. In the top-left corner of the work space, a heater from the 40s or 50s protrudes. On the right-hand side of this same workspace, a small stairwell leads down into the basement. The basement is a low-ceilinged, cement-floored area used as a space for cleaning and repairing rugs. Modern technology is surrounded by vestiges of older techniques—covered washbasins, rug hooks, and outdated appliances. The basement also has a bathroom and additional storage space for imported rugs.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>In the building’s original construction, the area described would have constituted the entire interior space—two wooden back doors reveal what used to be the outdoor courtyard through wired glass windows. The courtyard was used for washing and drying carpets until John Kebabian, father of the current John P. Kebabian, decided to turn it into an interior space for washing and drying. The interior space has within it a half upper story accessible by ladder and scaffolding that serves as a chute for wet rugs to get pulled up to the roof (by a pulley system) for drying. On the right-hand side of the half-story, a small door leads to the lower roof. Once outside, a six-foot ladder takes one upstairs to the main roof, where washed rugs are dried in the summer months. In order to keep the square paneling and vine-like detailing on the tin ceiling, the air vents were placed outside of the building and onto the roof. It was sometime in the past half-century that the roof was also rubberized, to ensure that no water would leak into the store and result in water damage of the rugs housed there.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>4 steel beams embedded in the roof suggest that at some point, the intention of the architect of builder was to add a second story. However, it seems like the next building investments and renovations that the Kebabian store hopes to make involve reinstituting neon lights into their iconic sign.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>','Carina Gormley','41.3079827','Unknown','Kebabian\'s Rug Store','','<p>The deep-red, one-story building, framed by a parking lot and tall masonry, Kebabian’s Rug Store stands out for its color, short height, large front windows, and retro sign. The building has served as the showroom and rug repair service studio for Kebabian’s Rugs since 1920. It has been in the hands of three different Kebabian’s, and has briefly seen to co-ownership with a washing machine company. Before the Kebabian’s existed a hardware store. Although the washing machine company and hardware store either left the site or went bankrupt, Kebabian’s Rug Store has withstood nationwide and citywide economic depressions, changes in home décor trends, and drastic changes in the neighborhood dynamic. The store has continued to serve the purpose that it served its founder in the late 19<sup>th</sup>Century—to finance a comfortable living for the family and college educations for its members. More often than not, these college degrees end up being from Yale University itself. The building is a rich piece of New Haven commercial history that reflects the commercial and social wants of the 21<sup>st</sup>Century citizen.&nbsp;</p>','1.5','103.9\' x 199.1\'','<p>1916-20: Weed and Co.

Kebabian Jr. purchases store from father</p>','<p>The building of 71-73 Elm Street is half a block away from the New Haven Green. Although the block is not frequented by Yale students as much as the nearby Chapel and Whitney commercial districts, it is still in a dense commercial area of the city. The density and height of the area dwarfs the site itself—the one-story building stands out as an anomaly beside it’s neighboring multi-story stone and concrete buildings. In the 1920s, downtown was the site of both large single-family mansions and bustling department stores. Prior to the World War, New Haven was a popular commercial district that would attract esteemed outsiders to shop and tour at leisure. Kebabian’s store had a strong relationship with the then-tenants of 59 Elm Street, Bullard’s Furniture Store. Many clients would visit the adjacent stores to do their high-end home furnishings.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>New Haven experienced strong economic decline in the 50s and 60s that changed the demographic of downtown’s street-goers. It was in the 70s that John Kebabian decided to install a rolling shutter for the display windows as a response to several instances of break-ins and robberies. Presently, the area has more through-traffic towards Union Station and Fair Haven than it does pedestrians. Those that do walk along the street are frequently employees of the nearby municipal buildings. The street is treated more as a transit road than as a promenade.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>','<p>Although the Tax Assessor’s website documents that 71-73 Elm Street was constructed in 1900, Sanborn maps and copies of the New Haven Directory indicate that the building was constructed sometime between 1911 and 1916. It’s first occupant, registered only as 71 Elm St., was Weed &amp; Co. Inc. saddlery and hardware. They remained there until 1922, where in 1923 and 1924, the building was registered as “Vacant.” In the year 1925, Mihran Haig Kebabian, nephew to the founder of Kebabian’s Rug store of 47 Orange Street, moved Kebabian’s Rugs from 59 Orange Street to 71 Elm Street. At the same time, Hallock F Co, which sold modern washing machines, occupied the 73 Elm Street address until 1928—it appears that at this point, they had gone out of business. Mihran therefore purchased the 73 Elm Street space and doubled the size of his Rug store. The founder of Kebabian’s rug store emigrated from his home in Istanbul, Turkey, to join his Turkish College’s partner school, Yale College. Although John C. Kebabian left Turkey as a way of escaping compulsory military service under a falling Ottoman Empire, he realized that the beautiful rugs of Turkey could be a good way to fund his college tuition. He made excellent profit selling rugs to the affluent parents of his classmates out of his dorm, and would buy a proper storefront on 47 Orange Street in 1888. His nephew, Mihran, would soon join him in the States and help run the business while John C. Kebabian continued his education. Mihran would take ownership of the store around 1920, see it through the Great Depression, and then pass along the store to his son, John. John brought about many structural developments within the rug store, to make the company more competitive during the economic downturn. Although John’s son intended to take a different path than his forebears by attending Tuft’s undergraduate school and pursuing a career in medicine, his father’s illness led him to take on more of the responsibilities of the shop and, upon his father’s passing, exchange his medical pursuits for store management. The son of John Kebabian, John Philip Kebabian, is the present owner of the store. The company currently has 6 employees, and were commissioned for all of the oriental rugs of the new colleges.

Haight, Peter Kosinski','Methodist Society ','Jiye Park','<p>Just across the northwest corner of the New Haven Green stands a brick edifice accentuated by white ionic columns and a towering steeple. Home to First and Summerfield United Methodist Church, the building is one of many places of worship located in and around the New Haven Green. A flight of stairs ascends from the sidewalk to the entrance to the building and vertical panels of stained glass windows decorate the sides.&nbsp;</p>','<p>John Lovell Lancasterian School</p>','<p>With the help of Yale University and the City of New Haven, the church was able to secure its present lot and commissioned Henry Austin, a notable local architect (1,4). Though initially built in the Federalist style, the building underwent many changes from various renovation projects over the years, resulting in the removal or alteration of many original features.</p><p>During the 1876 renovations, the entire sanctuary floor was raised and a chancel recess was added to the Northside of the building. The ornate cast-iron columns in the lower level, currently Trinity Hall, are survivors of the renovation. In 1890, the steeple was removed due to structural problems. (1,4) In 1904, following a devastating fire, further renovations of the interior and southern external façade were led by Federal Judge and Dean Henry W. Roger of Yale Law School and designed by Charles Haight (2). Haight used a hybrid Federal Revival and Eastern Orthodox style, installing a large central dome, which was structurally flat but appeared to be concave due to the optical illusion created with horizontal arcing ribs, and a new steeple. (1,4) In 1987, there was another fire that heavily damaged the roof, requiring another round of repairs. After a complete gutting of the space, which included removal of the roof, trusses, and sanctuary celling, architect Peter Kosinski redesigned the interior space but restored the roof and steeple as close to their original design (10).</p>','<p>The building sits on the corner of College and Elm St. with the Elihu Club to the right and Yale School of Music’s Leigh Hall located behind. Across the street is the northwest corner of the green.&nbsp;</p>','<p>The Methodist Society had endured 60 years of persecution, dislocation, disruption and disaster by the time the first building was erected on its current site. As the name suggests, there was a merger that took place in 1981 between the former First United Methodist, founded in 1789 in downtown New Haven, and the Summerfield United Methodist, founded in 1871 and based in the Newhallville neighborhood of New Haven, to give the First and Summerfield United Methodist Church present today (3).</p><p>The John Lovell Lancasterian School, a forerunner of New Haven public education, was briefly housed in the related church building located across the street on the green. Unfortunately, due to a great storm in 1821, the building collapsed and the school was forced to relocate (4).</p><p>In addition, the church has been a place of shelter for many groups throughout its history. Some of these organizations include the unions Local 34 and Local 35 of the Federation of University Employees, Local 217 of the Hotel and Restaurant Employees Union, Y.M.C.A. day-care programs, the Metropolitan Community non-denominational Church for homosexuals, and immigrants seeking sanctuary (5,6).</p>','<p>The 1901 Sanborn Map of New Haven and 1911 Atlas of New Haven depict a separate building—a parsonage—located behind the main building, which must have allowed for residential housing of ministers of the church (7,8). But according to the 1923 Sanborn Map, there is a merging of the two buildings, most likely a product of one of the many rebuilding and renovating projects that occurred (9).</p>');

It looks crisp and bright when compared to its neighbors, including an abutting brick structure on Temple, the New Haven Hotel on George Street, and the Temple Street Garage. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>	After renovations made in 2003-4 by Bow Tie Partners, the building now sports 44 luxury apartments and the Criterion Theater, which gets its name from Bow Tie’s Manhattan theater.

This metal apparatus, hanging from the brick façade by suspension cables, appears to float above entering moviegoers, a “cloudlike” half-moon that displays movie titles and shelters pedestrians from the rain (1). Illuminated by hidden interior lights, it speaks to the building’s long connection with electricity and industry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>          Criterion Cinemas and its marquee were introduced to this 1939 structure in 2003-4, when Bow Tie Partners, a New York real estate developer and theater operator, purchased the vacant building and “gutt[ed] and remediat[ed]” much of it (2). The original façade, designed by R. W. Foote, remains—parallel planes of ground-floor white Vermont marble and upper-floor red brick extending more than a hundred feet down Temple and George Streets. Anchoring the building’s L-shape is its raised, four-faced clock tower, also made of Vermont marble and topped with a “polygonal lantern with small arched windows on each side” (3). It calls to the white spires on the Green for which Temple Street is named. While the tower’s windows are Palladian, the façade’s glass portals are more typical of neocolonial architecture, with two panes bisected horizontally by a thin, white divider. Facing the building from Temple Street, its façade appears U-shaped, with the clock tower rising a floor above the rest of the structure on one end, and a less ornate tower doing the same on the other. Paradoxically, the central Criterion marquee, a floating breath of metal amongst the brick and marble, seems to hold the structure to the earth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>          Although the façade has remained mostly untouched, the interior was transformed in 2004. When the building was first constructed, it served as a multipurpose headquarters for one of New Haven’s largest utility companies—as such, its spaces were large and varied. Into this 112,000 square-foot structure, Foote crammed spaces for United Illuminating’s “administrative, sales, service, storage, repair and garage divisions”; one area, the “Demonstrating Auditorium,” showcased the electrical marvels of the interwar period: “ranges, water heaters, refrigerators, dishwashers, disposal sinks and small appliances” (4).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>          Bow Tie Partners, headed by Charles and Benjamin Moss, turned these commercial and administrative areas into 44 luxury apartments, Criterion Cinemas, and as-yet-unoccupied restaurant spaces. The Art Moderne movie theater lobby that resulted from these renovations sparkles with red carpets, golden walls, and metallic columns. Movie posters on its walls crackle as the lights surrounding them audibly buzz on and off. Furman &amp; Furman, the firm that designed the theater, aimed to create a “gathering place” which recalled the grandeur of the original building (5); this was achieved by including not only a café area, but also five-foot panels showing “switches, dials, gauges, and other electrical equipment” from United Illuminating (6). Though those panels no longer grace the lobby, a large mural, hanging over the café tables, speaks to the structure’s history with pictures of Bow Tie’s founders and the old UI building. Notably, the 1939 building also displayed murals in its public-facing spaces, including two by Yale graduate Jirayr H. Zorthian. The murals used allegorical figures to represent Electricity and Light—under Electricity’s right arm were “four great scientists who were pioneers in the discovery of this great power. They are: in the background, Thomas Edison; on the left, Michael Faraday; in the center, Count Volta; and on the right, Benjamin Franklin” (7). The current mural in Criterion’s lobby connects the relatively new space to this long history.</p>','<p>          Criterion Cinemas sits in a booming residential and retail area that it has helped to foster since opening in 2004. “You couldn’t imagine a more desolate place before Criterion moved in,” the executive director of the Town Green Special Services District told the <em>Yale Daily News </em>(8)<em>. </em>And, indeed, this section of downtown was struggling in the years before Bow Tie Partners brought in the theater. The vacant United Illuminating building faced the massive Temple Street Garage, and, beyond that, a gaping hole in the ground left behind when Macy’s department store went out of business. Temple Street was struggling to attract Yale students or the young professionals who were beginning to flock to resurgent cities like New York City and Boston.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>          But just two years after Criterion Cinemas opened as the “only major movie house in downtown New Haven,” then-Mayor John DeStefano could waltz down Temple Street with a parade of reporters and proclaim, “Temple Street is now turned into a neighborhood” (9) As evidence, he could point to a spate of new restaurants that had opened on the ground floor of the Temple Street Garage to cater to moviegoers; the fact that the apartments above Criterion Cinemas, in Temple Square, were full; and the announcement by Bow Tie Partners that they planned to introduce two new screens to their theater (10).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>          86 Temple Street’s surroundings today reflect the vibrancy that DeStefano noticed over a&nbsp;decade ago. Across the street, the four-level, concrete garage designed by Paul Rudolph still overshadows the UI building, but its ground floor hosts eateries like Roly Poly Sandwiches and Pho Ketkeo, a Laotian restaurant. A few buildings down is Olives and Oil, a wine bar occupying another former headquarters of United Illuminating. Barcelona Wine Bar also sits nearby. Criterion Cinemas anchors this restaurant and bar landscape, inviting students and professionals to couple movie-watching with bar-hopping. “The Criterion is to this side of town what the Shubert [Theater] and the [Yale Repertory Theater] are to Chapel Street,” DeStefano said in 2006 (11).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>          The UI building is one of the few Colonial Revival structures in this area, which is otherwise dominated by modern (and postmodern) facades. Importantly, the neighborhood does not yet look fully developed. It’s still in the process of revitalization—or gentrification, according to people who note the 250+ new, luxury apartments (12). Slices of surface parking cut into the block on which Criterion Cinemas sits, suggesting the potential for further building. It’s likely that future construction will lead to more structures like Temple Square, specializing in the same sort of “CORPORATE HOUSING…[with] short term and flexible leases” rather than middle- to low-income housing or retailing (13).</p>','<p>          After laying the cornerstone for United Illuminating’s new administrative building, UI president Albert Kraft “expressed the hope that the employees working in the new and adequate quarters would be able to give the customers the service and attention which they deserve, and thus make it possible for the company to expand in a manner that would be of decided advantage to the stockholders,” according to <em>Kraftsmen</em>, a UI newsletter (14). Yet the structure completed in 1939 and shown to the public in 1940 reflected little of the commercial spirit inherent in Kraft’s statement. Made of brick and marble, with a clock tower to rival the spires on the Green, the Colonial Revival building looked (and looks) more like a city hall or a post office than a company headquarters. This was, most likely, utterly intentional, meant to inspire the same awe and reverence as, say, Boston’s Old South Meeting House. Commercial goals were clothed in civic pride, with “walls of special rough texture brick” hiding the administrative and service headquarters of a regional industrial powerhouse (15).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>          The United Illuminating Company itself exhibits the same sort of tension between public and private ideals. As a public utility, it has certain obligations toward providing electricity to the residents of its service area, which spans from New Haven to Bridgeport. Yet, in many respects, it effectively operates like a private enterprise, with financial responsibilities toward its stockholders balanced against its semi-public nature. By the 1920s, UI had so successfully met those financial responsibilities that it was one of the city’s largest employers; its influence was often benevolent, helping New Haven attract “new industries” that required large amounts of electricity (3). The murals UI bosses commissioned for the building’s lobby revel in the importance of electricity to modern times. Painted by Jirayr H. Zorthian, the murals depicted Electricity and Light as two gargantuan figures, and traced the development of electric power from ancient times. Seen by UI customers looking to pay their bills or install new electrical equipment, they secured the building’s standing as New Haven entered the postwar era, so much so that it survived the ravages of urban renewal just across the street (see Story Map).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>          United Illuminating left the building in 1992 to move into a larger, suburban headquarters. When the structure was purchased by Bow Tie Partners in 2003, it began its journey toward becoming a major private anchor of the downtown commercial landscape once again.</p>','<p>          One of the earliest depictions of the site is on the 1824 Doolittle Map, which shows New Haven’s Nine Squares after they were split by new streets such as Temple and Crown (17). The corner of Temple and George appears empty on this map, suggesting that the location was either vacant or lacked buildings of significance (as defined by Doolittle and his municipal patrons). The first clear precedent of 86 Temple appears on the 1886 Sanborn Co. map, which displays a small, brick shoe manufacturer identified as Myers and Herz Shoe Co. in the 1888 city directory (18). Surrounding this building are the premises of the New Haven Electric Company (NHEC), from which the utility company provided electric streetlights to the city and private clients. It would become United Illuminating by the turn of the century.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>          As the NHEC (and later UI) expanded its landholdings along George Street and deeper into the block, the buildings along Temple Street stubbornly held onto their valuable frontage space. The 1911 directory makes no mention of 86 Temple, but the nearby 84 Temple houses the New Haven Progressive Building and Loan Association (19). Close by, where the UI clock tower would soon rise, stood the Eagle Hotel, a wood-frame hotel and saloon that defiantly held onto the street corner. Property owners on Crown Street would at one point band together to “see[k] damages alleged to have been caused by the [electric] plant’s operation”—given the amount of coal required to produce electricity at the time, that damage most likely had to do with the soot falling from the utility’s smokestack, which rose behind 84-86 Temple (20).</p><p>&nbsp;          </p><p>          By 1924, UI’s success as southern Connecticut’s major electric public utility had allowed it to buy out the property owners on Temple Street. In the 1924 Sanborn map, 82-94 Temple are a series of connected storerooms, housing the materials needed to create the “white-way thoroughfares,” or streets as well-lit at night as during the day, popping up all over downtown (21). The site would exist as such until United Illuminating, having grown out of its administrative headquarters at 124 Temple, chose to demolish the hodgepodge of service and industrial buildings on Temple and George in favor of the 1939 Colonial Revival building, the address of which was 80 Temple. 86 Temple reappeared in 2004 with the opening of Bow Tie Criterion Cinemas.</p>','<p>(1) Eleanor Charles.</p><p><br></p><p>(2) HBH Construction, “Criterion Theater &amp; Apartments,” <a href="http://www.hbhconstructionllc.com/865004006353/" target="_blank">http://www.hbhconstructionllc.com/865004006353/</a>.</p><p><br></p><p>(3) Preston Maynard, “Connecticut Historical Commission Historic Resources Inventory: United Illuminating Co.” (Hartford, CT, 1981), 2.</p><p><br></p><p>(4) John D.

Thus the neighborhood of Prospect Hill experiences an architectural taste where industrial and commercial buildings blend seamlessly with the neighboring residences. With historic and current uses both being what the name calls for, a firehouse, the geometrical mass of concrete and brick stands, visible from the street view, but half hidden in the theme of architecture omnipresent in on the street. The firehouse is open to the public during business hours, however there are always officers on duty in case of an emergency in the area. Patriotism flying in not only the American Flag staffed in the front yard but also the painted front bench, Whitney Station is home to Engine Company 8.</em></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>','80\' x 95\'','2 + basement','<p><em>The building exerts powerful masses of reinforced geometric shapes, facade is composed of brick and concrete; the concrete molded to resemble the ‘clapboard’ exterior of the houses. The coloring of the brick and masonry is gives off more neutral and earthy tones, allowing the pastels of the adjacent buildings to be illuminated by contrast.&nbsp;Interestingly, it is no taller than the adjacent buildings, even those across Lawerence St. Thus it seems the architects opted for this mass of solidity to serve as a foundation as well as an attraction for the eye, without distracting from the overall architectural mood amongst other Whitney Avenue buildings.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>	On the first floor of the facade, the three symmetrical garage doors present an array of&nbsp;rectangular glass panels, stacked vertically, decreasing in width as the panes get higher; the metal framing highlighting a brick-like pattern. The pattern of the garage windows could have been designed to represent the reinforced structure that is the sheer brute, functionality and reliability that is the fire station to the neighborhood of Prospect Hill; also reflecting back upon the motifs of mid-20th century Brutalism.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>	The second floor facade is ornate with, again rectangular window forming a symmetrical pattern of T’s. Like with the garage windows, the T’s could have been symbolic for the architect(s), reaching out toward the adjacent buildings and rooting them in the fire station, in the earth. This could again represent the importance of the building in a societal setting. Having the fire station provides a sense of security and safety to the other tenants and residents in the Whitney Avenue District. Jetting out from the north and south. sides of the garage are two rectangular columns topped with half gables made of concrete and brick. The rooftop is flat. The tower on the southwest side of the building is rectangular and made of brick; the west side of the tower is lined with a vertical column of rectangular windowpanes. The rest of the building appears windowless. The exterior divided in half: molded concrete on top and brick on the bottom. A parking lot sits to the south of the building and a flag pole stands in the front (west) near a brick placard with the name of the station.&nbsp;</em></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>','<p><em>The three architects, Carlin, Millard, and Pozzi, utilized the International Style of Architecture and as a model for the style of Brutalism. Brutalism, arising in the era of 1950s through the 1970s, “exhibited force and action amongst functionality” according to Scully, as seen in the firehouse’s display of stone and brick exterior (3). Vincent Scully praised Millard’s work calling it “ an active concrete castle, at the respected scale of traditional residential street of clapboarded wooden houses” (3) .The masonry was built into reinforced rectangular structures. The exterior was divided in half: brick and molded concrete. This division was the architects’ method for unifying the architectural styles of neighboring buildings. As seen in the the adjacent houses (Figure 4.), which display the wooden clapboard facades, that author Elizabeth Mills Brown considers to encompass an “English cottage appearance” (4). On the other hand, the brick work blends seamlessly with the all brick exterior of the New Haven Planned Parenthood Building, located directly across Whitney Ave (Figure 6). Interestingly, beyond the intersection of Lawrence and Whitney, the architecture switches drastically to more Queen Anne influence (Figure 5).&nbsp;</em></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>','<p><em>Looking at the sanborn maps below, analyzing the difference between 1924 and 1973, it appears most of the residential homes surrounding the site were already constructed. The original plot of land was one third the width (north to south), the other ‘two thirds’ of today’s plot contained what appears to be other residential or commercial buildings. There is a great possibility, that whatever buildings were overthrown by the construction of the fire station likely resembled those of Figure 4; quite possibly all being built by the same architect. These residential properties were documented under the addresses 346 and 352 Whitney Avenue. According to the 1924 sanborn map legend, these plots were once two - story dwellings, frame buildings. 352 Whitney Avenue plot also had an open hoist way on the property. However, under the 1973 map, the fire station rests on a single plot, addressed 350 Whitney Avenue.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>	According to the sanborn map legends, the fire station is a fire proof building built in 1962 (FPX-1962), but with walls made of mixed construction of concrete blocks and brick faced (CB BR F). The firehouse has reinforced concrete framing, floors, and roofing (A-1-a). Thus the sanborn map from 1973 agrees with inventory and data from national registers as documented below.</em></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>','<ol><li>1.“New Haven, CT Online Assessment Database.”&nbsp;Vision Government Solutions, Vision Government Solutions, Inc., 1 Oct. 2016,"</li><li>2.

The building, intended for the exact purpose of a multi-faceted combination of a commercial storefront and residential rooms, has undergone address changes (from 47-49 Dixwell since its construction to 51-53 Dixwell from approximately 1969 onward), as well as changes in tenants of the building and the storefront.&nbsp;</p>','Abraham Harmon; Jeremiah Clifford and William H.

Gross Area: 6,438 ','4','<p>The “Barbershop” is a four story brick building with a commercial storefront and multi-unit residential rooms located above, exhibiting a colonial revival style with low gable roofs and bracketed cornices. The storefront communicates a homely yet elegant ambiance by contrasting light and dark green colors to generate a welcoming vibe. There is a 6-pane window underneath the storefront roof, with two large panes on the outside and four panes in the middle — two larger panes on the top and two smaller ones underneath. To the right of the window is a barber’s pole, still spinning.&nbsp;Above the storefront consists the brick facade of the residential rooms, with three stories of canted bay windows, and segmental window headers with keystones. To the left of the building is a parking lot — which used to contain another building with a similar yet smaller archetype of the “Barbershop,” now demolished— where there are spaces available for a maximum capacity of fifteen cars.&nbsp;Behind the building, there are wooden stairs leading to each floor of the residential building, all doors of which contain numbered locks.&nbsp;</p>','<p>This building is located a little ways from the center of Broadway Avenue in New Haven, and is situated across from a few rundown houses and a parking structure, marking the beginning of a street filled with seemingly empty residential homes while at the same time marking the end of downtown New Haven.

According to the <em>New Haven Land Records (1)</em> within the <em>Historic Resources Inventory of Building and Structures (2), </em>the original building was constructed by Jeremiah J. Sullivan in 1898 for Isadore Stein and Frank A. Rourke as a multi-use commercial and residential building. It was named the Stein Rourke Tenant Building, and the first known occupants were in 1913 — to a clothing dealer named Abraham Harmon, and to residents Jeremiah Clifford and William H. Dorman. The current address of 51 and 53 Dixwell was formerly 47 and 49 Dixwell when it was originally built. This was due to a similarly built tenant house where the current parking lot is located, which had the numbers 51 and 53; the building is now gone. Over the past 120 years, there have been many different stores and tenants in the Stein Rourke Tenant Building.&nbsp;</p><p>	The residential apartments accommodated a variety of people, with as few as two tenants and as many as twelve at one time, while the storefront has been occupied by countless exotic stores. In 1923, the <em>New Haven Street Guide </em>showed that at 47 Dixwell there was a Tevelov Sol Fruits Store owned by Michael Diflumeri, with four people in the residential rooms. In 1930 the storefront was vacant with five residents; 1942 during World War II showed the storefront Federal Hat Works owned by Herbert and Orfino Repole, with five residents (all different from 1930); the Federal Hat Works stayed at 47 Dixwell in 1950, but the apartments were occupied by Alfone F Furniture, who seemingly worked next door but rented out the apartment rooms; In 1960, the Federal Hat Works were substituted by Dixwell Furniture Company with four tenants; In 1969, the <em>New Haven Street Guide (3) </em>marked the first year showing the transition of the “Barbershop” from 47-49 Dixwell, to 51-53 Dixwell, with Reaves Barbershop taking the storefront. From 1969 until 2015, the Reaves Barbershop enlivened the New Haven population as a black establishment bringing the essence of professionalism and culture into the outskirts of the college town <em>(4)</em>. The building is now owned by 51 Dixwell LLC <em>(5) </em>who is currently leasing it out to Yale students for off-campus housing. The currently residing students have seemed to like the tradition with the barber’s pole, and still call the house “The Barbershop.”&nbsp;</p>','<p>As the pictures of the Sanborn Maps <em>(6)</em> in 1911 and 1923 illustrate (in the archive documents and the pictures after the facade of the building), we can see that the modern “Barbershop” building was built in a neighborhood of economic growth in the early 20th century. The first two Sanborn maps taken in 1911 show that the Stein Rourke Building was in fact addressed 47-49, with a building assigned 53 Dixwell in the same lot. The map also shows the constructer of buildings, with J. G. Sullivan named as the architect of the Stein Rourke Building. It is fascinating to see however, that the buildings in the neighborhood have many various constructers, perhaps implying that many of these buildings were erected over time, not all at once. In the second picture of the zoomed out 1911 Sanborn Map, we can also see that there used to be a Dixwell Avenue School across the street, displaying a neighborhood intended to manifest a family friendly environment. In the last Sanborn Map picture of 1923, we can see that the Stein Rourke Building was separated into 47, 49, and 51 Dixwell (51 as a bake shop), with 51 1/2 and 53 Dixwell addressing the next door plumbing service in the same lot. The map shows some overlays of paper, indicating various address changes that may have altered the map during that time on Dixwell Avenue.&nbsp;</p>');

Large, inviting windows give a glimpse into the restaurant’s interior, while the brown awning brightens the street view. Mamoun Chater was a Syrian immigrant and the family’s Syrian heritage is present in the rich decorations (2). Interior decorations include rugs, traditional silver pieces, and numerous historical photographs, including one of Mamoun himself, flanked by decorative sabers and daggers. Desserts and drinks are displayed at the counter, with the rest of the space occupied by clustered tables. In warm weather, three small tiled tables serve as outdoor seating where patrons might sit and smoke a hookah pipe with their meal.</p>','<p>Situated in the Dwight Street Historic District, Mamoun’s is one of the newer buildings, sitting across from Howe St. Convenience &amp; Deli and down the street from Pizza House, all establishments that declare their presence through bright lighting and neon signage. The various residential buildings along Howe Street house singing groups, graduate students, various Yale clubs, and of course, New Haven natives. No doubt many of these residents are late night Mamoun’s regulars. The restaurant acts as a small teleportation device, bringing the smells, tastes, sights, and even sounds (Arabic pop can be heard from the kitchen radio) of another country to a small concrete box on Howe Street.</p>','<p class="ql-align-justify">Mary and Annie Ryder first occupied the frame building at 85 Howe. Both dressmakers, possibly a mother-daughter duo, the two set up shop until the mid 1900s (5). Here, the frame building gave way to concrete and with it, more modern occupants (10). Before the eponymous Mamoun and Muhammed Chater moved in circa 1977, a grocery store and a laundry inhabited the space (5). Now, Mamoun’s is run by the next generation, brothers Suleiman and Tarek (2). In 1985 the two purchased the space outright from Windsor Realty and have kept their doors open into the wee hours every day of the year through super storms and super Tuesdays. </p>','<p class="ql-align-justify">Little renovation has taken place at 85 Howe past a facelift to reface the outer brick façade (4). Similarly, the Mamoun’s logo has not changed since its creation in 1971 in the West Village. Wide curves and sketched lines evoke the psychedelic groove of its birthplace and era. A college favorite among all Yalies, especially those hailing from New York who count Mamoun’s as that city’s best Middle Eastern fare, one hopes Mamoun’s has many years left at its current location.</p><p><br></p>','<p>1) Connecticut Historical Commission. <em>Historic Resources Inventory Form.</em> Max Schlenker and Sandra Lee. “Mamoun’s Restaurant.” Hartford, CT.

These doors, which originally served as the entrance to a now-demolished Yale building, typify the house’s energy: surprisingly variegated, but stylistically coherent. Renovated in 2011 by Pike International specifically for the Yale Men’s Hockey Team, the second story’s bluish metal façade appears to clash with the first floor’s mottled concrete, until the purple front door manages to catch your eye and the motif. Inside is further evidence of the house’s adaptive reuse, with walls composed of recycled wood, and a spacious living room that still hints at the building’s past life as a commercial space. Non-athletic undergraduate tenants live there now, but the house continues to pop out from the block.</p>','2 (plus basement)','24’ x 81’','<p>1884*: Harriet F.

This appearance is purposeful: the building’s history was highlighted during its most recent renovation, and different segments of the house retain distinct appearances. The gabled portion of the roof covers the middle segment, which contains the kitchen, living room space, and an ADA-compliant bedroom and bathroom on the first floor, and three more bedrooms on the second (see photo 1). This segment’s façade was finished with blue-gray metal layering, which contrasts with the underlying brick and the dark concrete used in the very front of the building (2-5).&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Above both other segments of the house, the roof is flat, creating an (inaccessible) balcony in the front and an extended roof deck above the rear (1-2, 6). Stairs connect the middle segment to the back of the building, which is on a lower level and contains four more bedrooms with high, lofted ceilings. The side of the back segment is finished with cream-colored concrete masonry unit (CMU) blocks, which also cover the entire side of the house facing Howe Street (5-7).</p><p><br></p><p>Inside the house, reused materials predominate. Recycled wood was used in crafting several sculptural walls (10, 11). Exposed steel beams—with which the older wood frame was replaced in the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century—run along the entire ceiling of the middle segment’s first floor, continuing from the kitchen to the bathroom (14). Hardwood floors were added during the renovation. (See Site History for an extended list of reused materials and their sources). As per rooming house regulations, exit signs hang above the front and back doors (12-13). A ramp just inside the front door provides access to the first floor; on either side of the ramp are the stairs leading to the basement and to the second floor. </p><p><br></p><p>Given that the building was extensively overhauled in 2011, and refurbished again in 2017, the house is in impeccable condition inside and outside.&nbsp;</p>','<p>The Crown address situates the Hockey House a block removed from the Chapel shopping district. Historically, Crown Street has been one of the least densely populated streets in downtown New Haven, instead rife with automobile service companies. The block between Park and Howe continues the trend today: rooming houses and multi-unit residential buildings are interrupted by various flat spaces, including Enterprise Rent-A-Car, the Crown Towing company complex, and a parking lot for a commercial stretch of Chapel Street. The Hockey House’s distinct colors and style stand out from the businesses, but also from the other residential buildings on the block, most of which are of more standard forms. On the Howe corner, however, stands another rooming house designed by the same architect, Fernando Pastor, demonstrating similar principles of reuse. The various residential addresses are all inhabited by Yale students, resulting in an atypical blend of non-luxury New Haven businesses and off-campus student housing in the same vicinity.</p>','<p>The history of 380 Crown parallels the arc of American downtowns, adhering to the trends of commercialization over the course of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, and the burgeoning forces of gentrification in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. There has been a house of one form or another at 380 Crown Street since at least 1886. Early additions to the structure included a garage, denoting the automobile’s democratization and increasing presence in cities. By 1927, there are records of the building being used as a commercial space: the first floor was used as a store, though the second story remained residential. This layout proved long-lasting, even as the property changed hands. Notably, the owners of the property in the 20<sup>th</sup> century appear to have been of Italian descent; 380 Crown passed from Palmieri, to Santarcangelo, to Benedetto and Esposito. </p><p><br></p><p>Though that block of Crown Street has remained dense with auto repair shops throughout the decades, it appears as if this building was used as a plumber’s office before 1959. After that year, 380 Crown became the address of the John &amp; Sal Beauty Salon. The proprietors completely overhauled the building before opening their salon—which likely became a node in the surrounding community. City zoning regulations required that they continue to use the second floor as a residential unit; perhaps Benedetto or Esposito lived above their shop with their families. But, like so many other small downtown businesses over the latter half of the century, the salon ultimately failed; the property stood abandoned for a significant amount of time before Pike bought it for only $90,000. </p><p><br></p><p>When Pike, needing a house to develop for the hockey team, purchased 380 Crown, no Yale students lived in the area, nor did anyone expect to see student migration to this block. (The parking lots and auto-related businesses, which remain today, further accounted for the seemingly low price.) Fernando Pastor, the designer on the project, believes the construction of the Hockey House “pushed the boundaries.” This was also the first house or apartment that Pike developed beyond restoring a structure to livable conditions. Almost twice the amount of money that was spent in purchasing the neglected lot—$165,000—was poured into the renovation. Today, city tax assessors value the property at $378,500. Pastor and Pike have since converted another unused lot at the end of the block into two new rooming houses; Yale students, both undergraduate and graduate, have filled the houses in between.</p><p><br></p><p>In a 2011 <em>New Haven Independent </em>article on Pike’s development in New Haven, Shmully Hecht, the company’s founder, proudly declared he was clearing out the “cocaine central of New Haven.” That Pike is an agent of gentrification is obvious; the company spent aggressively during the recession of 2008-2009, consolidating its hold on over 1,000 apartments across the city—including a conspicuous volume around downtown, close to Yale’s campus. Pike had foresight; rents continue to climb as more students push the radius of upscale development further away from campus. The history of the Hockey House also makes clear who has been displaced along the way. </p><p><br></p><p>But the flow the Hockey House has ushered in is also contentious because of its future. Even as Yale continues to invest in the residential college system, students still seek independent spaces away from campus, defying the university’s wishes. (In the 2017-2018 year, more than a quarter of juniors, and almost 40 percent of seniors are living off-campus; Yale hosts an off-campus housing fair for graduate students, faculty, and staff only.) But this new sort of rooming house seems to offer a reasonable compromise for the school and its students: strictly regulated by zoning code, these structures are safe as well as spacious; and since they are designed for groups hoping to live together, they might preserve suite dynamics. In addition, such spaces can serve as foci for alternative social scenes—potential rebuttals to fraternities that seem perpetually embroiled in troubling scandals.</p><p><br></p><p>From its earliest history as a family home, through its mixed use as a combined store and residential unit, past its time as a beauty salon amid car shops, and up to its current state as a dual marker of architectural innovation and urban renewal, the salient story of the Hockey House has always been reflective.&nbsp;</p>','<p>The 1886 Sanborn Co. map indicates that 380 Crown, along with the adjoining plot, were owned by a Harriet F. Robinson. These buildings were most likely single-family homes; in 1924, this was still the case. (One residential real estate website states that the house presently standing at the address was actually constructed in 1920, meaning the original structure would have been torn down.) In 1927, Alfonso Palmieri—ostensibly the homeowner—added his garage (18, 19). The house would still have been wood-frame (15), and the garage introduced concrete and “rubberoid” materials to the site. By the 1950s, the ground floor of the building had been converted into a store owned by Frederick J. Santa (22). Besides work on the storefront, alterations during the decade included enlargements to the garage and the back porch, indicating that attention and money were still invested in the residential portion of the structure (20, 21).&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>1959 was a momentous year in the history of 380 Crown. This was when Salvatore Benedetto and John Esposito—the proprietors of John &amp; Sal Beauty Salon—filed for a permit to shake up the building (23, 24). Their construction resulted in the shape and structure we see today (16, 17). Besides the rear section appended to the existing house, they also replaced the old wood frame with steel, and incorporated more concrete into the building. The last documented construction activity in the beauty parlor period came in 1973, when Esposito did more work on the storefront (25). It is unclear when the salon failed, but though the property remained under the Esposito name until 2011, it was abandoned and boarded up long before Pike International purchased the plot. </p><p><br></p><p>The renovation in 2011 is better described as a rebuilding; the abandoned structure was completely gutted and imagined anew. Pastor acknowledged that the renovation was a “very unusual process.” The Yale Men’s Hockey team had already hired Pike to design a house for them before the company had purchased the derelict property or hired a designer. Pastor, employing principles of ecological sustainability, needing to abide by rooming house regulations, and hoping to pay homage to Eero Saarinen’s Ingalls Rink, produced an idiosyncratic plan that Pike’s contractors speedily executed. The renovation was completed in September of that year.</p><p><br></p><p>(Recycled materials in the house include black-stained oak floors, railings, and stainless-steel balusters from a house in Millbrook, NY, deconstructed in 2001. That same house supplied the Brazilian granite that adorns the bar and kitchen. A 16-foot-long oak church pew was taken from St. Bernadette Parish in New Haven and placed in the living room area as permanent seating. Bars and decks were transplanted from a bowling alley in Hamden, CT. The paneled oak door of Yale’s former Brewster Hall became the distinctive decoration at the entrance. Blackboards from a school house in Vernon, CT now serve as backsplash in the kitchen, and the metal kitchen sink came from another recently-demolished home. If that was not enough, the same wood used to board up the abandoned house was reused in the sculptural walls in the basement, kitchen, and living room; and rafters from the roof were repurposed into an entrance screen separating the living room from the entrance. The final touch: a Saarinen sketch for Ingalls Rink was converted into a mural and painted onto a basement wall.) </p><p><br></p><p>The hockey team, lamentably, sullied the house to the point where they moved out after only five years. After sitting empty for a year, Pike refurbished the house (with new interior paint schemes), and a new group of Yale undergraduates, affiliated with a co-ed fraternity, became tenants in fall of 2017.</p>','<ol><li>“380 Crown St, New Haven, CT 06511 - Estimate and Home Details | Trulia.” Trulia Real Estate Search.

Today, the High Victorian Gothic building is the last remnant of the 18th and 19th century College Street residential neighborhood, serving as a reminder to busy passersby of the city’s long history.

It is one of three restaurant buildings dwarfed by the massive entertainment and industrial buildings surrounding it. As a main throughway connecting New Haven with the highway system just a few blocks south, College Street is bustling with cars and pedestrians at all times of day. The block features the more contemporary-style Schubert Theater, College Street Music Hall, and the Crown Street Garage. However, the Bartlett House’s unique High Victorian style adds an element of quaintness and serenity to the busy downtown atmosphere. In the summer months, the shaded front porch of the house offers an inviting refuge for hungry customers looking to enjoy a bit of live music and good, southern food. The Bartlett House keeps a growing street pedestrian friendly, and stands as a reminder of New Haven’s evolving history.</p>','<p>The William Bartlett House was originally the residence of Mr. William T. Bartlett, an employee of the Treasurer Union Trust Company. His family occupied the residence for nearly thirty years before passing it on to other local families, including real estate agents and nurses. The building remained a home until the early 1940s. Then, taking advantage of the expanding commercial downtown district, the Sudock family chose to convert the lower floor of the residence into a restaurant, and regulate their family home to the upper floors. In the 1960s and 1970s, the building transformed into a true mixed-use space, with multiple apartments on the upper floors and a beauty salon replacing the Sudock restaurant. In the 1990s, the Bartlett house was purchased by the Samurai Japanese Restaurant and remained a prime New Haven sushi spot until being taken over by the Queen Zuri in 2017. The transformation of the Bartlett house from a residential duplex into a commercial restaurant reflects the expansion of the New Haven downtown and eventual regulation of residential spaces to the outer edges of the original nine square grid. Its stark presence as such a beautiful Victorian townhouse amidst the more industrial buildings surrounding it today is a reminder of that history.</p>','41.306369','Unknown','William Bartlett','Unknown','<p>The William Bartlett House has stood in the same form since its creation in 1876, however the neighborhood surrounding it has undergone an immense transformation. When first constructed, the Bartlett house was one of dozens of residential homes on College Street and in the surrounding areas. It shared a block with the College Street Congregational Church and stood around the corner from Carll’s Opera house and the Grand Union Hotel. Its prime location just a block from the Yale University campus likely made the land well-desired by local New Haven residents. By the mid-1900s, the College and Crown street neighborhood was beginning to transform into a mixed-residential and commercial space. While it still remained a family home, some of the former residences across the street had been converted into apartments and office space, and the Taft Hotel had taken up residence on opposite block. An entertainment hub, the Shubert Theater across the street now attracted hundreds of people from around Connecticut to see productions of vast expense. No longer a quiet neighborhood, the Bartlett House too began to grow with its neighbors and by the mid-1900s had itself become a mixed-use building, hosting restaurants, hair salons and other businesses on its lower floor.</p>','<p>The Bartlett House is a 2.5 story brick townhouse built in the High Victorian Gothic style. It was originally constructed as part of a residential duplex, however its 232 College Street counterpart was torn down at the beginning of the 20th century to provide an alleyway for access to the public parking lot at the building’s back. The first story is raised off of the sidewalk, providing for a small courtyard at the front of the building. Once a front lawn, it has now been paved over with cement and is currently used as outdoor restaurant seating during the spring and summer months. The building’s windows are long and rectangular, and framed by cut-stone masonry. The current owners have chosen to accent the bright red brick with blue framing, creating an almost storybook feel for the outside of the property. Similarly, the off-center front door of the building is covered by an ornate, columned pavilion. The slate gabled roof is accentuated with intricate iron crossings that further evoke this mythical ambiance. </p>','<p><span style="color: black;">Chapel Street Commercial Historic District, National Register of Historic Places Inventory, United States Department of the Interior Heritage Conservation and Recreation Service.</span></p><p><span style="color: black;">Chapel Street Historic District Documentary Collection (1936), New Haven Colony Historical Society, Dana Archive, New Haven Museum, New Haven, CT.</span></p><p><span style="color: black;">New Haven Chapel Street District Sanborn Maps, 1886-1976.

The structural footprint—two rectangular boxes connected by a shorter, one-story box—prizes symmetry and rectilinear space. This striking hub of community life inverts conventional elevations by dwindling, rather than growing, towards its center. Regardless, United Church, established on the New Haven Green in 1742, retained its colonial heritage in this mid-century expression of urbanism.</p>','None','9,587 sq ft','2','<p>This two-story, symmetrical building emphasizes horizontality above all else. T-shaped concrete slabs repeat along the roof, projecting continuity across the one-story chasm between each two-story rectangle. Concrete also frames the brick siding in orderly quadrants. This exterior subdivision of space—a modern visualization of colonial era scale—masks the building’s larger interior volume. Yet, for all its order, the plan is somewhat unapproachable, with only a slight overhang at the entrance door to suggest invitation to passers-by.</p><p><br></p><p>The paralleled exterior disguises dramatically different functions for the two large rectangular spaces: viewed from Temple street, the left contains an open gathering space; the right contains two stories of classrooms and offices. Most importantly, it inverts conventional plans by shrinking—in all 3 dimensions—towards its center, connecting rectangle. Thus, the entranceway serves as a sort of tunnel between two, isolated nodes of activity. The building narrates its own use: all enter through a small chamber to reach the final destination of shared space. In this way the Parish House prizes communal gatherings facilitated through requisite meekness.</p>','<p>Towering structures of adjacent Church Street—Chase Bank, The Taft, and 2 Whitney—loom above the Parish House and render it a mere stage to much grander verticality. Despite its relative stature, the Parish House’s brutalist façade contrasts with the golden window treatments of Chase Bank and the warm red exterior or 2 Whitney. The structure also interacts with Yale’s Timothy Dwight College across Wall Street, a similar composition of brick and white-trimmed colonial windows.</p>','<p>The earliest map of 1886 depicts an unidentifiable building on the lot that would become 323 Temple (4). Since 1901, however, the Samuel Hemingway House stood on the lot and belonged to Yale University. In 1959, United Church expressed interest in exchanging its existing Parish House at 302 Temple (today’s Yale University Press) with Yale to acquire 323 Temple (5). The <em>Yale Daily News </em>reported the deal’s acceptance in January of 1960, quoting then-Reverend Alexander Winston as saying, “the church plans a modified colonial-type structure of red brick with white trim” (6). The Parish House Finance Committee was established and hired Dwight Building Company to raze the old Hemingway House (5). Pedersen-Tilney, a local New Haven architect, was chosen to design the house in its signature Brutalist style (5). Since its completion in 1961, the only only one renovation occurred in 2013, which replaced flooring and gave an interior facelift (5). The exterior has remained unchanged.

Several belt courses of rosette pattern terra cotta and white stone wrap around the structure, and these same rosette patterns are reflected in a checkerboard pattern on the front gables.</p><p>Round arched openings punctuate the gables on the north, south and west elevations. The round arches include delicate wood sunburst pattern panels, and are topped by wonderful radiating voussoirs of alternating red and white bricks. This same alternating and polychrome brickwork is also visible above the other windows of the structure, though the ornamentation remains flat in the wall. A small, round staircase window on the third story breaks the symmetrical pattern of the rear elevation, giving it an almost whimsical and humorous character. The decorative elements of the roof remain modest: the entablature below the eaves is only slightly molded and held by few brackets marking each corner of the structure.</p><p>Though it lacks many of the typical Gothic motifs such as ogees and elaborate roof trims, the presence of arched and poly-chromed brickwork as well as Romanesque brackets may indirectly call to the Queen Anne, Late Gothic Revival and Romanesque Revival styles which so inspired architects of the 1860s. The intricate patterns of the roof, systematically alternating from gabled to hipped, evoke the complex and steep roof-work of Queen Anne architecture, and perhaps even of Stick-Eastlake homes. Even in the interior of the structure, the door leading to underground storage is clearly inspired by the Gothic Revival style, and has been conserved for this purpose.</p><p>However, the overall structure of the apartment home seems too structured and rationalized to conform to High Victorian Gothic. Though not entirely symmetrical, the building brings to mind Colonial Revival architecture through its configuration of windows. Typical colonial homes would incorporate two windows on each side of the entry door, five windows on the second floor with one window standing on top of the entry door. 98 Howe Street seems to be built as if cutting a colonial structure in half: it only carries two windows on the right side of the entry door, and three windows on the second floor. Though painted red and green instead of the typical white, the house includes a pediment fitting the entrance, a feature which is also prominent in post-Georgian and colonial style architecture.</p><p>The building was mainly restored in 1984 for historical preservation, leaving its structural condition fairly intact. The ornamentation of the exterior walls, the roof and interior staircases were repaired or replaced with matching materials. The existing roof structure was reinforced and repaired by replacing the slates, although the nails currently holding the slates are apparently deteriorating. The restoration project helped re-consolidate the cut-stone foundation, brick chimneys, copper downspouts, mechanical systems, wood and tile floors, interior walls and ceilings, and furthermore proceeded with the insulation of windows and walls, leaving a home which is still today very secure and reliable to its tenants particularly through cold winters. The landscape surrounding the building was even preserved, leaving trees that have been standing near the site for decades as well as newly added bushes which match the original landscaping.</p><p>Main additions include a new front porch with a modern design carefully crafted to match the original style of the home, as well as a new interior staircase extending to the third floor. Over time, interior walls have been continuously added and removed as the structure transitioned from a single-family home to an apartment building. (17)</p>','<p>	98 Howe stands in an area which may be considered rather residential, despite its placement in the BA (“general business”) Zoning district. The two-way street provides a large gap between facing structures and most buildings are spaced apart, creating a spacious and comfortable streetscape. The neighborhood was designated as an area of minimal flooding hazard, contributing to the sense of security and comfort of the space.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">	The Dwight neighborhood is generally composed of 2-3 story buildings, with a high proportion of Victorian dwellings. The north and south side streets are often tree-lined and homes, such as 98 Howe, are generally set back by front yards.</p><p>	This particular section of the street hosts many apartment buildings mainly designated for Yale students, thus creating a relatively quiet and empty atmosphere, even though restaurants and shops occasionally occupy the ground floors of certain dwellings. 98 Howe Street accurately reflects the character of the neighborhood since it is entire populated by Yale undergraduates and graduate students.</p><p>	However, 98 Howe Street, along with its twin structure on 94 Howe Street, remains one of the few single-standing homes in this particular stretch of the street. It is mainly surrounded by larger-scale apartment buildings, and consequentially creates an interesting interruption within the general rhythm of the streetscape.</p>','<p>98 Howe was initially built in 1865 in the Dwight neighborhood, a district laid out in the traditional grid-pattern street plan, mainly destined for the middle, working class.</p><p>Various snapshots from Sandborn maps of 1888, 1911 and 1923 unveil the narrative of this district’s development as surprisingly static and slow. 98 Howe and many of its</p><p>neighboring buildings have been standing in the same lots through the century, and the fabric of the landscape remains overall unchanged. As a historical district, many of the original structures in the area have been conserved, allowing us to examine the various architectural styles that were prevalent at the time of their construction, mainly from the 19th and early 20th centuries.</p><p>The working class initially began to occupy this neighborhood because of its proximity to the more industrial sectors of the city. Many worked in the lighter industries such as carriage parts and building trades. In line with its design for the working class, the Dwight neighborhood stacked together numerous row-houses or structures of similar patterns. Most homes accurately reflected the modesty of their inhabitants through their simple clapboard frame structures. Towards the west of the district, Italianate and Queen Anne-style homes showed slightly more elaborate in their design and façades, but would nonetheless be shared between multiple families who could not afford to build their own homes. (20)</p><p>98 Howe, however, belonged to the wealthier portion of the Dwight neighborhood. Many local professors affiliated with Yale University were primarily responsible for promoting the area, building free-standing homes instead of row-houses, using more expensive material as well as more complex ornamentation. (20) Indeed, 98 Howe remains one of the special free- standing brick structures of its neighborhood, initially designed for a single family. Victorian style structures with brick instead of wood frames were considered exclusive to affluent clients.</p><p>However, New Haven’s city directories indicate that 98 Howe quickly transitioned into a multiple-family apartment home. It is suggested that, with the rapid influx of Polish and Italian immigrants in the 19th century, 98 Howe housed several families for a short period of time.</p><p>By 1913, the house was already inhabited both by engineer George W. Bigelow and window manufacturer Merrill Loomis. In 1931, William M. Lee occupied the home and was one of the few to include telephones in his personal residence, suggesting that he was quite wealthy.</p><p>Starting from the 1940s, it seems that most residents were renting furnished rooms within the building from owners who lived in different addresses, and that most belonged to the working class.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">By the 1970s, 98 Howe was owned by companies which seemingly leased the spaces out officially. In line with New Haven’s economic decline of the 1960s, the building might have been inhabited by people of lower socio-economic backgrounds.</p><p>Following New Haven and Yale University’s vigorous attempts to renew and revitalize certain neighborhoods, 98 Howe became closely affiliated with the university, housing many of its students. By 1995, Off Broadway Inc. acquired the building and, to this day, still offers many housing opportunities to the student body of Yale university as well as to other professionals around the area.</p><p>Over time, 98 Howe has housed people of various backgrounds and stories, accurately reflecting the progression of New Haven’s broader social history. However, one common theme remains: for most of its lifetime, the structure has housed several families and individuals simultaneously. Through this very specific function, 98 Howe has provided shelter to distinct populations and social classes, targeting either lower-income individuals during New Haven’s economic depression or students following the neighborhood’s revitalization.</p>','<p>	98 Howe stands in the northern edge of the Dwight neighborhood, one of the richest areas of New Haven in terms of its history and architecture.</p><p>	The sector was initially a mere plot of land lying on the edge of Yale University’s campus, on which impoverished African-Americans built a series of shacks and shelters. Its development only began with the rise of New Haven’s industrial growth, following the war of 1812, and the subsequent growth of its population. With the increasing need for guns and other hardware, New Haven steadily built its economy around the manufacturing of arms and carriages. When the town of New Haven built a new canal to Farmington in order to gain greater access to major ports, the city was flooded with an influx of laborers, causing dramatic urban and population expansion.</p><p>	The Civil War further added 23,000 to the city’s population, causing New Haven to gradually overflow beyond its original nine squares. (1) Speculators, predicting that laborers would want to build homes near the industrial center of the city, saw potential in the Dwight neighborhood and bought large plots of land in the area. The population consequently became mainly composed of workers employed by carriage firms and other resident artisans. Meanwhile, the African-American population increased simultaneously following the Civil War, creating a well-integrated community along with Jewish, Italian and Polish immigrants.</p><p>	Dwight neighborhood first saw its decline following World War II, with the increasing migration of residents and the need to convert buildings to multi-residential use. Although the population’s rise came to a halt, the district became increasingly commercialized and less attention was paid to the preservation of the neighborhood. As part of the 1950’s urban renewal plan, the city began to clear the land in an effort to provide residential complexes for low-income families, but only succeeded in further impoverishing the area. The recent history of the Dwight neighborhood has been mainly characterized by neglect and obliteration, with a declining interest in maintaining its buildings.</p><p>	Just recently, the Dwight Street district was officially declared as part of the National Register of Historic Places, causing many structures, such as 98 Howe, to be refurbished and renewed.</p>','<p>(1) Dwight Street Historic Trust.</p><p>http://nhpt.org/index.php/site/district/dwight_street_historic_district/.</p><p><em>(2) City of New Haven Directory.

It is considered quintessentially in the Art Deco style; it was made using the most modern materials and methods in line with interwar conceptions of luxury and displays great symbolism through its imposing nature and numerous motifs. The building was considered of sufficient architectural merit to be listed in the National Park Service’s National Register of Historic Places in 1997.</p><p><br></p><p>The building was the tallest building in New Haven for decades. The use of large vertical lines, bright stone, and ornamentation compels passers-by to look up at it in awe. This is in line with its historical use: SNET, who started planning the building in 1928, was one of the most important companies (and one of the biggest employers) in Connecticut. Hence, the SNET Administration Building was to contemporaneous architecture as SNET was to southern Connecticut.</p>','<p>This 17-story Art Deco building lords over the New Haven Green in light-grey limestone. There are windows at consistent intervals (both vertically and horizontally) on all four sides of the building. The windows are surrounded by steel grills. All four sides of the building display iconographic motifs.&nbsp;</p><p>The verticality of the building is emphasized by the large, seamless columns which continue with step-backs on higher floors. All elements of the exterior come together to form tall vertical rectangles. The top step-back of the building was at one point entirely a service area but has more recently been carved out to make apartments.</p><p>Behind the limestone skin lies a core of steel and concrete. The interior is as ornately decorated as the exterior, featuring extensive use of marble and ornate wood. Carved into the lobby floor by the entrance is the outline of the state of Connecticut in metal alongside text that reads “1878 1938”—1878 being the year in which SNET built the first telephone exchange in Connecticut and 1938 being the year that the SNET building was constructed. The lobby also features bronze furniture designed specifically for the building by Douglas Orr, the building’s primary architect. Above doors in the lobby are flying swans, presumably alluding to the speed of telephone communication enabled by SNET. Almost all fixtures in the lobby are made of either red marble or metal. The ceiling of the lobby consists of layers of equally spaced squares with lamps in the middle, giving it the same style as the exterior rectangles and windows. </p><p>The original first floor spanned approximately 20 feet with a small mezzanine to allow for communal spaces (e.g., an auditorium, a library, and a cafeteria) on the peripheries of the building. These spaces were converted into offices in 1948, though many of the original panels and fixtures were kept. Even less important communal spaces, like bathrooms, feature extensive use of marble. </p><p>Many of the original materials and fixtures were retained when the building was converted into apartments; the reader is encouraged to visit the site should the opportunity present itself to experience the full extent of the use of luxury.</p>','<p>The SNET building lies one block offset from the New Haven green, placing it squarely in the city’s downtown. It is surrounded by other institutional/commercial buildings, making its surrounding blocks an area of work rather than residence. It lies next to the Trinity Evangelical Lutheran Church, built in 1870. It was the tallest building in New Haven between 1938 and 1966 when both The Omni Hotel and the Kline Biology Tower were built. Despite this, the building remains a key part of the New Haven skyline. Given the luxury underlying its construction and general grandeur, the building acts as a tower of commerce: i.e., it marked the point at which that area of Church Street became a place of wealthy companies rather than residences.</p>','<p>The building was—as its name suggests—purely an administrative building from its construction in 1938 to its acquisition by a real estate developer, Connecticut Properties LLC, in 1997. It provided jobs for around 1,200 people at its peak, making it an important player in New Haven’s economic history. Moreover, the presence of the telephone company in New Haven implies the city’s connectedness with the world at large.</p><p>The building’s construction was a turning point for that area of downtown. Prior to it, the area was primarily residential (see site history); today, it is in one of the tallest areas in New Haven.</p><p>After the building was sold to a real estate developer, its nature changed dramatically. Part of the first floor became a credit union while much of the interior of the building was repurposed for housing. The building’s current name, “The Eli,” implies a link with Yale University; in reality, before the building was re-opened in 2004 as luxury condos, there was little social overlap between Yale and the SNET building.</p><p>In some ways, the building has not changed that much in character. It was designed as a building for luxury-capitalism, and it remains one—albeit in an altered form. The wealthy company for which it was constructed has moved out, but affluent members of the New Haven community have filled the grand space with a new generation of wealth.&nbsp;</p>','<p>Prior to SNET’s acquisition of the site, the immediate area was entirely residential. SNET purchased and demolished four small residences to build the building and its parking lot. Immediately before the building’s construction, Emily H. Whitney is listed as living at 227 Church Street. Prior to SNET, the site was generally unremarkable.</p>');

The simple design of two towers, one clad in granite and the other in glass, was Robert Orr’s winning design for the former home of the New Haven First National Bank (“First New Haven National Bank”). Situated in the 9th square of the New Haven grid, the building is nearest to the Yale Health Center, the Knights of Columbus Building and the New Haven Connector (Maynard). Though originally built in 1961 for the increasingly powerful First New Haven National Bank Group, the building is currently used as office space for various organizations due to the bank’s closure. The most notable of these tenants are the US Consulate for Ecuador and the Yale Center for Outcomes, Research and Evaluations. During the period of redevelopment in the 1950’s and 60’s in New Haven, most of the land near the plot of 1 Church Street was being leased, however the economic power of the First New Haven National Bank as the primary lender for redevelopment positioned the organization well to purchase the lot for their headquarters (Domhoff).</p>','90\' by 165\' approx','8','<p>The original tenant of 1 Church Street was the First New Haven National Bank until the bank’s closure in 1984.

The masonry tower is taller than the glass though the two are connected in the lower levels of the building. The first floor has an entrance of poured concrete with a series of square columns to hold the building’s weight. The shape of the building as a whole is boxy and modernist, with hints to Mies van Der Rohe’s elegant contrast of glass and metal. The building sits atop a parking lot with access from Church Street. Along the building’s southwestern face are a row of trees that line the street separating the building from Columbus Park.</p>','<p>The First New Haven National Bank Building is situated on the corner of Church and George Streets in the 9th square of the New Haven grid system. The building’s closest neighbors are the George Street Parking Garage, Columbus Park and Gateway Community College’s North Building. Both the Knights of Columbus Building and the New Haven Connector are visible to the south of the building and three blocks to the north is the New Haven Green. This area has contentious history due to the urban redevelopment that occurred in the 9th square in the 1960’s under former mayor Dick Lee (Domhoff). See Social History for more information.</p>','<p>Since the First New Haven National Bank’s creation in 1961, the building has been occupied by the First New Haven National Bank, McGladrey and Pullen Accountants, The Consulate of Ecuador and the Yale Center for Outcomes, Research and Evaluations. The New Haven National Bank operated in the area until it was acquired in 1984 by Connecticut National Bank ("First Bank."). From this period on, the building’s floors have been rented out by a series of tenants who held offices within the building. Prior to the building’s creation, the area housed a series of small shops and a parking garage (see Sanborn map from 1924). The creation of the building itself was highly contentious because of its inclusion in the redevelopment during the Dick Lee era of New Haven from 1954 to 1969. Within this era, Mayor Lee focused his efforts on changing New Haven’s reputation from a slum city to a city of the future. On Church street alone, his efforts to redevelop ended up forcing over 800 small businesses to close ("Richard Lees Urban Renewal in New Haven."). In other areas, Lee’s efforts would displace families, destroy homes and uproot many ethnically rich communities within the city of New Haven. </p>','<p>The Church Street district in New Haven is an area that changed significantly before urban redevelopment. Before the construction of the First New Haven National Bank Building, various smaller stores operated within the 9th Square. As seen in the Sanborn maps, usage changed slightly over time, however most stores remained relatively small and were owned and operated by local New Haven residents. In Sanborn maps approaching the age of redevelopment, a parking garage was plainly visible, representing a shift from pedestrian and streetcar travel to personal automobiles. This shift from smaller stores to commercial centers and parking garages was increasingly common, as New Haven tried to reposition itself as an economic hub in the new age of the automobile. Exact site history is difficult to pinpoint due to the many small stores that operated within the area pre-redevelopment but it is fair to say that the use has shifted from small commercial enterprises to large office buildings.</p><p><br></p>');

Whitney Gymnasium has been entirely owned by Yale University. While little seems to have changed about its exterior façade, the gym has gone through profound changes.(1) The building has developed through the University’s history, such as the addition of new locker rooms and reconfiguration of different amenities in 1969 to accommodate the first class of women admitted to the University.(1)</span></p><p><span style="color: black;">Payne Whitney Gymnasium has served Yale and its community in various ways throughout its history, playing an important role in both the social and educational fabric of the University and the city. In 1978, for instance, The Yale Glee Cub and Orchestra performed in the gymnasium, and in 1942 and 1974, the Exhibition pool served as the stage for professional theatre productions.(1)</span></p><p><span style="color: black;">Today, community programs often hold afterschool activities including Squash Haven, one of the leading youth development programs in New Haven that serves 100 students from 24 New Haven public partner schools.(7) On any given day, athletes, students, faculty and spectators walk in and out of the building to exercise or to watch or participant in various tournaments. Even the Yale Hackathon, a collaborative computer programing event, is held annually at the gym. </span></p>','41.313887','<p><span style="color: black;">Payne Whitney Gymnasium, designed by Architect John Russel Pope and completed in 1932, is Yale’s third athletic complex since the school’s founding. Viewed from across Tower Parkway, the massive structure has been known variously through the years as the “Cathedral of Sweat,” “The Temple of the Body,” or “Yale’s great winter playground.”(1) As one stands in front of the building’s grand entrance, one cannot help but be overwhelmed by its monumentality. While the lush elm trees soften the power of the stone, the rigid form of the structure, the narrow windows and large oak doors amplify its sheer size and reflect Yale\'s commitment to athletics and fitness as the largest building on campus. It has 30% more cubic space than Sterling Library, and is the second largest gym in the world by cubic feet.(1) The structure’s design is equally impressive. Architect Pope won the silver medal in architectural design at the 1932 Los Angeles Games for his structure.(2)</span></p><p><span style="color: black;">The building is a memorial to Payne Whitney, B.A. 1898, gifted by his wife and children.(1) The complex consists of a central tower, which is nine and a half stories tall, two five story wings that house the John J. Lee Amphitheater and the Robert J.H. Kiphuth Exhibition Swimming pool, and a brick and glass addition on the Lake Place side, the William K. Lanman, Jr. Center. Most of Yale’s Varsity teams have lockers and practice spaces in Payne Whitney. The facility also includes recreational spaces such as basketball courts, swimming pools and an indoor track, which are open to the University’s student, faculty and affiliated members. </span></p>','<p>It is hard to give a fair description of Payne Whitney. The building measures 510’ x 206’ with a 200’ central tower.(1) The entrance is grand with large glazed oak doors, and the structure boasts elements of Gothic aesthetic such as pointed arched window opens, corner buttresses and intricate stone carvings.(3) Inside, one can expect to see ornamented arches and grand entranceways.</p><p>When plans for the structure were first being considered in the 1920s, Everett Meeks, the Dean of the School of Fine Arts in the 1930’s proposed a plan for a gym with an architectural compromise, hoping for a “dignified style and of such exterior materials [that would] harmonize with the surrounding university buildings.”(1) Architect Pope delivered. The magnificence and monumentality of the Payne Whitney Gym was inspired by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott’s Gothic Liverpool Cathedral in England. (1) The structure also boasts exterior walls made of sandstone from the Briar Hill Quarry in Ohio.(1)</p><p>Since 1932, Payne Whitney Gymnasium has gone through various additions and renovations. In 1999, the University completed the addition of the William K. Lanman, Jr. Center.(4) Designed by Ellerbe Becket Architects with Cesar Pelli &amp; Associates, the center added 57,000 square feet to the facility with new basketball and volleyball courts and an indoor running track.(4) In 2007, the gym underwent its largest exterior renovation. The restoration was proposed in 2005 when the Yale Physical Plant wanted to replace the building’s old windows to save energy.(5) The total project took around seven years to complete and cost around $93 million dollars.(5) Restoration included repairing six acres of wall space and 105,000 square feet of roofing, replacing all 2,560 windows and cleaning the pollution off of the stone exterior.(5) After many years, the blue scaffolding finally came off the building in 2015.</p>','<p>The sports complex was built on York Square street and was originally far from the campus’s center. As a result, architect Pope wanted to connect Payne Whitney Gymnasium with the core campus through its sheer size.(6) The building once acted as a “great wall”, dividing the campus from the rest of the New Haven Community (as can be seen by the floor plans of the first floor).(6, 8) The original structure had no central corridor that connected the front entrance to the back.(6, 8) After the addition of the Lanman center, however, the interior was reconfigured and an entrance was added to the rear of the building. While the main entrance is still in the front, the new entrance reflects Yale’s greater integration with the community. As Architect Pinnell puts it, the addition was friendlier to the Lake Place community compared to the main structure because it scaled down its size and made it more aesthetically accessible by “putting a rhythmically articulated wall of varied materials next to the side walk, and using translucent glazing that shows figures in motion.”(6)</p><p>Since 1932, the school has expanded immensely with the introduction of various new colleges and the admittance of female students in 1969. Today, the gym is very much integrated within the campus and plays an important role in the lives of the students, faculty and New Haven community. The structure sits on Tower Parkway across from Morse and Stiles Residential Colleges, and is adjacent to Ray Thompkins House, Yale’s athletic administration office.&nbsp;</p><p>As one crosses the street from the colleges towards Payne Whitney, the sidewalk extends out into a circular path with benches in the center and elm trees aligned along the building’s entrance. One can expect to hear the sound of cars revving their engines as the street light turns green, mixed with the sound of chatter as students often sit on the benches while they wait for buses to take them to the University’s fields.&nbsp;</p>','<p><span style="color: black;">Prior to the construction of gym on York Square Street, the land was occupied by private homeowners. The York Square neighborhood bragged a greenery park in the center.(8) Sanborn maps dating from 1888 show how homes were perfectly arranged around the greenery in generous lots, with each house positioned inwards to admire the greenery.(8) When plans for the gym began, the greenspace and lots were converted. Eventually the road was widened and renamed to Tower Parkway, the road which we know it as today.</span></p>','<p>(1) Yale and Payne Whitney Gymnasium, Fifty Years, 1932-1982.

That same year, Davenport preached his first sermon on the site at which Center Church on the Green (then called the First Ecclesiastical Society) still stands. The first meeting house was built on the site in 1639, and the current building—the congregation’s fourth meeting-house—has stood since 1814. </p><p>Over its nearly 400 years of existence, First Church has served crucial social, political, and religious functions for the city of New Haven. It was a crucial part of state government, and received state tax revenue, until the Connecticut state constitution was rewritten in 1818. One of its ministers, the Rev. James Pierpont, was instrumental in bringing Yale to New Haven in 1701. The basement of the current building houses a crypt in which many of the colony’s first residents—including Davenport and Eaton—have found their final resting places. </p><p>Today, Center Church is the centerpiece of the Green’s three churches. While its political and even social functions have dwindled drastically since the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> centuries, it remains a vital historic and traditional monument in the center of the city’s most prominent public space. The congregation still worships every Sunday, making it the oldest church in the city.&nbsp;</p>','<p>Center Church’s architecture is in the Post-Georgian, Federal style, consciously modeled after British churches constructed by James Gibbs like St. Martin-in-the-Fields in London. The steeple of Center Church, like that of St. Martin’s, has its steeple centrally located behind the pediment, above the interior of the church—an unusual architectural move for its time, when steeples were often located to the side of the main structure.<a href="#_ftn1" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[1]</a> After its use in St. Martin’s, this innovation became increasingly popular—the steeple at United Church next door is located in a similar position. </p><p>The exterior of Center Church is entirely brick masonry, with the exception of the columns, doors, and steeple, which all have a white-painted wood exterior. There is a marble arch above the main entrance with historical detailing which was added in the mid-1800s.<a href="#_ftn2" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[2]</a> The sides of the building feature wall arches built into the brick, encasing Gibbs-style windows.<a href="#_ftn3" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[3]</a> A hugely important feature of the exterior is the steeple itself, a square wooden tower which rises a floor above the roof level and culminates in a 2-tiered spire.<a href="#_ftn4" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[4]</a> There is a clock on the outside of the tower, and the steeple encloses the church’s current bell. The bell original to the structure cracked as it was ringing out a fire alarm in 1853, and the city of New Haven purchased the current replacement from a company in Troy, New York in 1854.<a href="#_ftn5" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[5]</a> &nbsp;</p><p>The interior of Center Church exhibits many fascinating architectural aspects. The sanctuary, which has both a ground floor and a balcony, is covered by a domed ceiling supported by scissor trusses.<a href="#_ftn6" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[6]</a> Several of the numbered slip-type pews are marked by plaques bearing the name of the congregant who originally purchased it. Over time, the sanctuary has gone through several variations. The pulpit, which originally rose to two full stories high, was lowered to a more practical one-story version in 1842. At that time, the balconies were lowered as well.<a href="#_ftn7" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[7]</a> The windows of the church have also undergone several renovations throughout the years—in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, the original paned windows were replaced with stained glass windows, which were removed in the late 1960s. The only stained glass window remaining in the sanctuary currently is the Tiffany Studios-designed window directly behind the pulpit. That window, donated in 1894, depicts founder John Davenport preaching his first sermon in New Haven on April 25, 1638.<a href="#_ftn8" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[8]</a></p><p>Perhaps the most unique feature of Center Church lies beneath its imposing sanctuary and towering spire. This is the crypt in its basement. When Center Church was constructed, the New Haven Green still functioned as a cemetery—and the church was built over 137 graves dating back to 1638. The graves and grave markers were left in their original positions, encased and protected by the foundation of the structure. The floor of the crypt, once cement, is now overlaid with brick in order to release moisture from the soil and protect the grave markers. The ceiling is supported by several columns.<a href="#_ftn9" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[9]</a> The crypt is available for tours during the months of April-October. </p><p><br></p><p>  <a href="#_ftnref1" target="_blank">[1]</a> Summerson 320-7</p><p><a href="#_ftnref2" target="_blank">[2]</a> Historic Resources Inventory</p><p><a href="#_ftnref3" target="_blank">[3]</a> Ibid. </p><p><a href="#_ftnref4" target="_blank">[4]</a> Ibid. </p><p><a href="#_ftnref5" target="_blank">[5]</a> <a href="https://ctcryptkeeper.wordpress.com/2016/08/08/bells/" target="_blank">https://ctcryptkeeper.wordpress.com/2016/08/08/bells/</a> </p><p><a href="#_ftnref6" target="_blank">[6]</a> Historic Resources Inventory</p><p><a href="#_ftnref7" target="_blank">[7]</a> Ibid. </p><p><a href="#_ftnref8" target="_blank">[8]</a> <a href="http://centerchurchonthegreen.org/history/architecture/" target="_blank">http://centerchurchonthegreen.org/history/architecture/</a> </p><p><a href="#_ftnref9" target="_blank">[9]</a> <a href="http://centerchurchonthegreen.org/history/crypt/" target="_blank">http://centerchurchonthegreen.org/history/crypt/</a> </p>','<p>Center Church sits in the center of the southeast side of the New Haven Green, facing away from Yale’s Old Campus and towards New Haven City Hall. It is flanked on either side by Trinity Episcopal Church and United Church on the Green, each of which was constructed within five years of Center Church. To modern sensibilities, the prominence of these three religious institutions in New Haven’s most important public space is a reminder of the degree to which Christianity is interwoven with New Haven’s past, even as its influence continues to decline in the present. It is also a reminder of the important, even elite role that the Green once played in New Haven politics and social life. Today, the Green serves as a public space, a park, and a home for many New Haveners who are currently without a traditional place to live. Center Church, along with the other churches on the Green, has increased its outreach to this population in recent years, reflecting a new clientele that has shifted as the downtown space has morphed from a center of elite activity to a space where the socioeconomic stratifications present in the city are incredibly clear. </p><p>The section of Temple Street bordering the Green is itself an enclave from the commerce and bustle that characterizes the rest of the street. Northeast from Center Church along Temple are Yale buildings—residential and classroom—and the street is heavily used by undergraduates, grad students, and faculty when classes are in session. Southwest down Temple is a slew of restaurants, bars, and theaters—the center of the city’s nightlife. The three churches and the Green itself serve a dual, somewhat contradictory function—as physical visual barriers between Yale and downtown New Haven which simultaneously occupy a space that ought to let residents, in theory, cross from one of these spaces into the other.&nbsp;</p>','<p>"Center Church on the Green – New Haven, CT."

The Reverend John Davenport, one of the colony’s founders, organized the congregation with New Haven’s original Puritan colonists—including the colony’s first governor, Theophilus Eaton, who is buried underneath the current building. Over the ensuing nearly four centuries, the congregation has had four meeting-houses, all on or near the same site, and gone by several names (including the First Ecclesiastical Society, First Congregational Church, First Church of Christ, and the contemporary Center Church). The underlying institution and location, however, have remained constant since the founding of New Haven—making Center Church central to understanding New Haven’s religious and civic history. </p><p>New Haven and the state of Connecticut were founded as Congregationalist enclaves, and so Center Church (which was Congregationalist) was intimately tied to civic life from its founding—receiving funds from state taxes and participating explicitly in state government. This state of affairs persisted until church and state were formally separated in the Connecticut state constitution of 1818, called by some historians the “bloodless Revolution of 1818.”<a href="#_ftn1" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[1]</a> Yet even then, New Haven served as the co-capitol of Connecticut from 1701 to 1873, and the statehouse stood immediately across the Green from Center Church, on the College Street side near the university. Depictions of the state house and the church from this period often depict the two structures as part of the same landscape, illustrating the church’s continued importance in the civic life of New Haven even after its explicit influence had ended. </p><p>The church also served an important function as an early bridge between town and gown. The Reverend James Pierpont, a storied and widely influential reverend of the church, was instrumental in relocating Yale College from Saybrook to New Haven in 1701. Because of this connection, Yale students attended church in the church’s meeting-house from 1701 to 1757, when the University constructed its own chapel. Yale commencements took place in the meeting-house for nearly two centuries, from 1701-1895, and to this day graduating students march around the building during the commencement procession to commemorate Center Church’s traditional, sustained relationship with the university.<a href="#_ftn2" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[2]</a> </p><p><br></p><p>  <a href="#_ftnref1" target="_blank">[1]</a> <a href="https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog?f%5Boffice_id_ssim%5D%5B%5D=ON027&amp;f%5Bstate_name_sim%5D%5B%5D=Connecticut&amp;range%5Bdate_sim%5D%5Bbegin%5D=1817&amp;range%5Bdate_sim%5D%5Bend%5D=1817" target="_blank">https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog?f%5Boffice_id_ssim%5D%5B%5D=ON027&amp;f%5Bstate_name_sim%5D%5B%5D=Connecticut&amp;range%5Bdate_sim%5D%5Bbegin%5D=1817&amp;range%5Bdate_sim%5D%5Bend%5D=1817</a> </p><p><a href="#_ftnref2" target="_blank">[2]</a> <a href="http://centerchurchonthegreen.org/history/more-history/" target="_blank">http://centerchurchonthegreen.org/history/more-history/</a> </p>','<p>Center Church and its congregants in various iterations have owned and used the land at 250 Temple Street since 1638, when it was purchased by John Davenport and Theophilus Eaton from the Quinnipiac tribe under the leadership of sachem Momauguin.<a href="#_ftn1" target="_blank">[1]</a> In the more than 375 years since, a meeting-house has existed on the site in 4 forms—two small wooden ones, built in 1639 and 1670, and two brick ones, built in 1755 and 1814.<a href="#_ftn2" target="_blank">[2]</a> </p><p>At the time the current structure was built, the Green also functioned as a cemetery. The current structure, which was constructed from 1812-14, was built over several of these graves. The basement of the church thus functions as a crypt, where the graves of some of the first residents of New Haven colony still lie—including that of Eaton, the colony’s first governor. The remainder of the grave markers on the Green were moved to the New Haven Burying Ground (later called Grove Street Cemetery) in 1821, and so Center Church’s crypt is an important historical marker which, in some sense, captures the New Haven Green as it once was.</p><p><br></p><p>  <a href="#_ftnref1" target="_blank">[1]</a> <a href="https://yipp.yale.edu/bio/bibliography/momauguin" target="_blank">https://yipp.yale.edu/bio/bibliography/momauguin</a> </p><p><a href="#_ftnref2" target="_blank">[2]</a> Historic Resources Inventory.&nbsp;</p>');

For a short period of time, it also housed the Yale Law School.</p>','<p>City Hall is located on the perimeter of the New Haven Green— a location often perceived as the city\'s leading public space. On a typical day, street-food vendors, local government officials, school children, and people of all backgrounds can be found on the outskirts of the building. City Hall’s position and the sense of community it conveys, highlights its importance and centrality in an array of New-Haven-related events.&nbsp;</p>','<p>Constructed in 1861 by Henry Austin, New Haven\'s City Hall is considered to be the finest and earliest example of High Victorian Gothic style within its vicinity. Its facade provides a blend of Portland and Nova Scotia stone, spiraling colonnets, and monumental arches that are split by a lantern-adorned tower. Through its use of such large Gothic detailing, dominating position over the New Haven Green, and contrast against its modern surroundings, this historic building claims a sense of authority and civic grandeur. The New Haven City Hall was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975— one year prior to the demolition of the original interior and its accompanying annex. Since its inauguration, this structure has endured a series of preservations, restorations, and new constructions— showing the city of New Haven’s desire to incorporate its past with its rising urban landscape (1).</p>','<p>Upon its construction, New Haven\'s City Hall featured an intricate facade of Portland and Nova Scotia stone, and a roof decked in multi-colored slate. These factors, combined with its arched portals, spiraling colonnets, quatrefoils, and carved foliate bosses, not only allude to Austin’s architectural expertise, but also to the majestic nature of the building. Additionally, its strong resemblance to the 1859 Fuller and Jones Canadian Parliament— which is primarily seen through its Tudor windows, Gothic windows, and looming tower— exhibit “a remarkable affinity for English taste.” The interior in 1861, although described as unimaginative by the New Haven Preservation Trust, contained a four-story iron spiral staircase, oak wainscotting, and a “polychrome tiled vestibule.” (4) After its reconstruction in 1985, the interior of the building became much more simplistic. The walls were coated in plaste and the floor was veiled in white terrazo— showcasing a neglect towards the detail-oriented architecture of the past and a favoritism towards the functional.</p>','<p>In the mid-1900s, New Haven "had become a poster child for the blighted American city"— a label which officials like Mayor Richard C. Lee sought to discard. Seeking urban renewal, New Haven "[declared] war on the seemingly inefficient and unmodern" aspects of its neighborhoods (1). </p><p><br></p><p>As a result, City Hall came under the scrutiny of the public which began to call for a modernized Government Center. (1) Members of the New Haven Historic Trust, however, countered this notion. They believed, as Vincent Scully puts it, that City Hall represented “the increasingly rare, still living fabric of another past life style [in New Haven] that [the city] would be infinitely poorer without (4).”<sup> </sup></p><p><br></p><p>Ultimately, "a spirit of compromise prevailed" and while the interior of City Hall and its annex were demolished, its intricate facade remained. To the dismay of many, lack of government funding prevented the construction of the new City Hall. Thus, in 1985, Newman Architects built a “more modest” version of the original building — "a ghostly echo of its predecessor." (1)</p>','<p>Prior to 1861, New Haven’s City Hall did not exist. The plot of land that used to be 161 Church St. and is now 165 Church St. was allotted to a family residence. (2) Construction for City Hall began in 1861 and the building was officially opened for use and to the public in 1862. Since then, City Hall has remained in its position.&nbsp;</p>','<ol><li>Ewbank, Anne. "Hall Past." Daily Nutmeg. Last modified June 15, 2017.

Norton carriage house, the Yerkes Laboratories of Primate Biology, the Prospect Hill Day School, the Yale Observatory, and the Yale Astronomy Department. In 1956, when the Astronomy Department took over the space, an addition was designed by architect Andrew F. Euston to accommodate the department’s needs.

Its brick material is clearly visible, painted over in an unusual green-blue hue. The simple Italianate structure is complicated slightly by some subtle details: the slightest oval curvature of the tops of certain second-floor windows and the somewhat playful bricks sticking out directly beneath the roof add character to this otherwise unassuming structure.</span></p><p><span style="color: windowtext;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: windowtext;">Many alterations of the building were made over time. Richard Carroll explains, “an addition designed by Andrew F. Euston was constructed in 1956 when the Department of Astronomy moved to this location. In 1976 it became office space for the School of Organization and Management, and was extensively remodeled in 1978 from plans by Edward L.

It faces the “Whale” (Ingalls Rink) diagonally across the Sachem and Prospect Street intersection. In warmer months, many students and members of the Yale community enjoy taking breaks to enjoy the picnic tables and benches peppering the building’s courtyard, sometimes with lunch from the food trucks in the Ingalls Rink parking lot in tow.&nbsp;</span></p>','<p><span style="color: windowtext;">See information under “Past Tenants.” Additionally, Sanborn Maps of this area at the intersection between Prospect Street and Sachem Street contextualize how the land in this area was used prior to the current structure. No prior structures existed at the site. Maps from the Digital Humanities “Gathering A Building” project also demonstrate the lack of structures on the site before the building was constructed.

Approximately every twenty feet, there is a larger ornamental line post structure which raises about two feet higher than the rest of the fence; at the top of this post stands a decorative bowl, sitting on a flat structure inscribed with the Winged Sun of Thebes, a symbol associated with royalty and power.</span></p><p>	<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Shortly after entering the Cemetery one stumbles upon a small Victorian style red brick two-story chapel built in 1872. Just below the roof there is a gold butterfly, which, according to the pamphlets published by the Standing Committee of the New Haven City Burial ground, “symboliz[es] the flight of the soul.” The condition of this building is very good; the red bricks bright and clean. The maroon paneled doors, however, look quite aged, definitely purposefully not replaced in the last few decades; the left panel bearing the address of the Cemetery: 277 Grove Street.

Designed by Henry Austin and Hezekiah Augur to supplement the New Haven Green as a burial ground as a consequence of overcrowding due to the rampant spread of the disease, Senator Hillhouse galvanized groups of local prominent families to create a new burial ground on what was farmland. As the first cemetery in the United States designed with the intention of having designated family plots, social and status stratifications were undoubtedly reinforced through its utilization despite it being a communal space. Indeed, the Cemetery embodied a paradox of equality and exclusivity (an assortment of white abolitionists and influential African-Americans may be found buried there), but nevertheless was highly segregated— Yale alumni, people of color and poor people all confined to their respective corners within its 18 acres. </span></p><p>	<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Grove Street Cemetery was named a National Historical Landmark in 2000, noted by the United States Secretary of Interior for its Egyptian Revivalist gate symbolizing an architectural trend of romantic-classicism of the time. This choice was meant as a nod to antiquity— designed to immortalize the past echoed within traditional burial rituals of lots, graves, and markers serving to forever represent the dead. Though the block on which it sits is rather quiet and less traversed than the streets found on either side, York and Prospect, the relationship between the Cemetery and the outside community (mainly the Yale Campus) appears rather symbiotic. It is to be noted, however, that the college’s president Arthur Twining Hadley had commented upon the the inscription “The Dead Shall Be Raised” a quotation from Corinthians 15:52 saying “</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">They certainly will be, if Yale needs the property,” perhaps gleaning insight on the relationship between the University and the surrounding areas through witticism. </span></p><p><br></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The site that is now the Grove Street Cemetery was largely farmland owned by the Fitch Family, and utilized by Nathan Mansfield as well as the prominent Hillhouse family.</span></p>','','41.31264840000001');

Facing the building to your right is the New Haven Green and to your left is a sampling of the highway and larger New Haven area. In this way, you really feel like you can see many different angles of New Haven. In a city with shadowy corridors, this street crossing opens up to the sun. In a way, you feel simultaneously at the heart of and outside of New Haven. The building was built in 1909 for the United Illuminating Company, a major business that provided electricity to the entirety of the city. It became a bank in 1940, and as we moved from the 20<sup>th</sup> to 21<sup>st</sup> century, it changed hands from one restaurant or bar to the next. Olives and Oil, an Italian restaurant, currently occupies it, which has been fitting for a building with such splendid Renaissance Revival architecture. A part of the New Haven Preservation Trust, this building holds substantial historical significance.</p>','<p>Abraham Heaton House (-1909) on the lot before</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>New building built in 1909:</p><p>United Illuminating Co. (1910-1940)</p><p>Morris Bank (1940-unknown)</p><p>Sanborn map of 1973 labels it as a bank</p><p>In recent decades, it has been several different bars/restaurants.</p>','<p>The building is three floors. It was originally two floors, with the third added in 1916. It is built in Colonial Revival/Renaissance Revival style. The façade is a mixer of brick and stone. There are intricate rounded arches and pedimented windows. The carvings include floral designs, lion gargoyles, and wreaths with marble in the center. This marble is used throughout to add to the uniqueness of the building. The brick is interspersed with terra cotta details to create a colorful pattern. The first floor is arcaded, with large archways around the entrance with Greek columns and pilasters. The flat roof is emphasized by an intricate framing that alludes to the crowning balustrades that were common of this architectural style. From old pictures and drawings, it is evident that the original style of the building has remained intact, and it is largely the same.</p><p>(Source 1 and 9)</p>','<p>The building is in the thick of downtown New Haven, right off the Green and the busy Chapel Street commercial area. Traffic is dense, and buses and cars constantly roll by. It is neighbored by many other restaurants, like Barcelona Wine Bar and Brother Jimmy’s BBQ. The façade of the building above Brother Jimmy’s BBQ is also grandiose, but of a later style, with cleaner lines and carved eagles. Like many parts of New Haven, beautiful buildings are hand-in-hand with run-down buildings, and the surrounding area includes some deteriorating, unkempt parts. However, this building, built in 1909, has been a constant in the area, watching the city grow around it and maintaining its central location and commanding presence for over a century now.</p>','<p>Previously on the site was the Abraham Heaton House, labeled a “dwelling” by the 1901 Sanborn map. Torn down and put in its place was the current building, built specifically for the United Illuminating Co. in 1909. One of the most magnificent of the time, it was built by one of New Haven’s leading architects, R.W. Foote. The turn of the 20<sup>th</sup> century was marked by mass industrialization. This building pointed to the arising goal of creating a cleaner, more elegant city, as cities were becoming overcrowded and dirty. Around this time, Frederick Olmstead, another famous architect, drafted elaborate and ambitious plans for the growing city. However, the plans were largely ignored and forgotten (Source 9). This building, and the failure of the Olmstead plans, signify the elegance and wealth, and the aspirations for elegance and wealth, that existed before World War I and the Great Depression (Source 2). The Chapel Street area was becoming a fashionable retail district (Source 2), something still central to the personality and identity of New Haven today. In 1938, the United Illuminating Co. built a new office building at 80 Temple, and Morris Bank moved in in 1940. For the rest of the century, it was mostly used as a bank - it is depicted as a bank in the 1974 Sanborn Map. Around the turn of the century and up until today, it has switched hands from one restaurant or bar to the next, and it is currently Olives and Oil. Temple Street as a whole remains very similar to when it was first built-up in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century (Source 2).</p>','<p>Prior to the construction of this building, the Sanborn Map of 1901 showed another building marked as a dwelling. According to a document in the DANA collection at the New Haven Museum, it was the “old Abraham Heaton House”. In 1909, the United Illuminating Co. started building the current structure. They moved in in 1910. In 1938, they started construction on a new office location at 80 Temple Street (Source 2). They moved in 1940, and Morris Plan Bank moved in (DANA Collection). It is hypothesized that ownership moved between several banks throughout the second half of 20<sup>th</sup> century, as the 1973 Sanborn map labels it as a bank. During the past few decades, it has switched hands often between different restaurants and bars. According to the City of New Haven Online Assessment Database, it was owned by “132 Temple St. Inc.” through 1993, owned by “PRE Properties New Haven” through 2007, and then moved to its current owner, the First Bank of Greenwich. The building has retained its original design, style, and structure since its construction in 1909; the only major change was when the third floor was built in 1916.</p>','<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"PHMC Italian Renaissance Revival Style 1890 - 1930."

Metcalf and R.H. Robertson','Brian Ronai','Book and Snake Society','Stone Trust Corporation','40x70','2','Stone Trust Corporation','<p>The building on the corner of High Street and Grove Street is the home of one of Yale’s most mysterious secret societies: Book and Snake. Sitting on a rectangular lot enclosed by an imposing iron fence with intermittent stone posts, the building’s sleek marble exterior and grand Greek-style columns on the front façade evoke a robust sense of importance (3). Like many other of Yale’s secret societies, this elaborate meeting hall is referred as a “tomb” and has no windows, further adding to the aura of mystery. The tomb was originally constructed as a gathering place for the Society of Book and Snake and it currently serves the same purpose. However, much like the contents of the interior of the tomb, the contents, purposes, and inner-workings of the society itself are shrouded in secrecy. (1,3)</p>','<p>The tomb was originally built for and is still owned by the Stone Trust Corporation, which is one of the previous aliases of the society (2,4). The society was originally founded as the Sigma Delta Chi Society in 1863. However, wanting to distinguish itself from fraternities, the society dropped the Greek title, changed its name to the Society of Book and Snake, and incorporated as the Stone Trust Corporation in 1876 (4). However, the building was not built until 1901, and, therefore, has only ever been inhabited by the society under the name of Book and Snake.&nbsp;</p>','<p>Just as the Secret Society of Book and Snake evokes an elite sense of importance, the Tomb of the society does just the same. The rectangular shape of its smooth marble exterior is only interrupted by four sturdy yet eloquent columns that support a grand triangular pediment surmounting the portico of the front façade (3). The two bronze doors that sit beneath the portico and between the columns are the only part of the Tomb that differs from the off-white shade of marble that covers the entire exterior. Aside from a partial internal renovation in 1933 and occasional upkeep of lighting and plumbing, the building remains unchanged from its original form (2).</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Built in a Late-Classical Revival Style, Book and Snake Tomb is modeled after the classical temples of Ancient Greece. The four iconic columns of the front façade have capitals marked with patterns of leaves and vines, and show particular resemblance in both structure and style to the Greek Temple of Nike (3). These marble columns support the large and pronounced triangular pediment which adds to the Tomb’s striking similarity to its Ancient Greek counterpart.&nbsp;</p>','<p>The style and presence of the Tomb is consistent with the classical style and appearance of formal importance of the buildings within the Yale Central Complex on Grove Street between College Street and High Street (1). The off-white marble, eye-catching dome, and general classical style of the Yale Bicentennial Buildings (Schwartzman Center and Woolsey Hall) allow the buildings to appear significant and serve significant purposes as a central part of Yale’s campus (1). Though Book and Snake Tomb fits the classical mold of the buildings with which it shares a city block, the entrance of the Grove Street Cemetery faces the Tomb from across Grove Street. The Egyptian Revival columns and portico of the cemetery’s grand entrance noticeably contrast with the classical feel of the Tomb. Regardless, it cannot be argued that both the Tomb and the cemetery portray an ancient sense of importance from opposing sides of Grove Street.&nbsp;</p>','<p>Since the building’s construction in 1901, it has served the sole purpose of a meeting hall for the Society of Book and Snake (2). Though the society has operated under other names such as Sigma Delta Chi and the Stone Trust Corporation, the Tomb has only belonged to the society since it took its current name, Book and Snake (4). Due to the secret and mysterious nature of the society, nothing is known about the actual activities and events that occur within the Tomb’s marble walls.&nbsp;</p>','<p>Based on information obtained from Sanborn Fire Insurance maps and the archives of the New Haven Museum, the land on which the Tomb of Book and Snake sits was previously uninhabited and undeveloped (1). However, the site is directly next to the Yale Bicentennial Buildings of Hewitt Quadrangle including Woolsey Hall and the Schwartzman Center. Since both the Bicentennial Buildings and the Tomb were built at the turn of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, it is very possible that the site was obtained by Yale University with the intention of it being the site of a bicentennial building. Nonetheless, the Tomb has allowed the site to match the classical style and important feel of its surrounding buildings for over 100 years.&nbsp;</p>','<p>1.)

Though the structure on the 100 College Street plot has only stood since 2015, the narrative of the site traces back to the 19<sup>th</sup> century – a time when New Haven served as a bustling industrial hub for peoples of all races, ethnicities, and religions. Until New Haven’s renewal period under Mayor Dick Lee, this site did not properly exist as 100 College Street on the city’s map, instead standing on Factory Street among a bevy of small crossing streets typical of the industrial urban landscape. However, as time progressed into the 20<sup>th</sup> century, New Haven’s shift towards the car and the highway led to the city’s preoccupation with enabling easy accessibility for vehicular transportation into the city. Given the site’s location just off I-95 – between Downtown and The Hill, the entire area surrounding Oak Street was leveled to create space for Route 34, or the Oak Street Connector. At the edge of the Connector’s plan, the plot of land at 100 College Street thus became part of this urban project. Still, the intention to serve a public good left 100 College Street to pay urban planning’s steepest price. Ultimately, the failure and termination of Route 34 not only displaced and destroyed the economic and social dynamism of the neighborhood, but it also left the site of 100 College Street unusable and vacant for decades. Such was the history of the site until the 2014 announcement of the Downtown Crossing Project, an ongoing redevelopment initiative that aims to transform the remnants of the Oak Street Connector into both pedestrian and car-friendly space. It so happens that 100 College Street was deemed to be the first and central piece of this monumental new city project. Consequently, construction of the towering, modern building that today stands on the site began in 2013 and was completed in 2015. Alexion Pharmaceuticals, a bioscience company known for its blood disorder medication Solaris, purchased the 14-story building and declared the impressive, Elkus Manfredi-designed structure as its headquarters in 2016. Standing west of the Knights of Columbus building and north of the Yale New Haven Hospital and Yale School of Medicine, the Alexion Pharmaceuticals building represents a new phase of urban and economic growth in New Haven. With its sleek and angular glass façade, 100 College Street reflects the city’s simultaneously modern push for both business activity and neighborhood inclusion in urban development. While Alexion did announce its relocation of its headquarters to Boston in 2017, the company still plans to maintain 100 College Street as an active center for research and development. In all, while the site carries a significant if not tumultuous past, the future looks bright for 100 College Street as a potential new hub in the city of New Haven. If history is any indication, 100 College Street will continue to write the New Haven narrative. &nbsp;</p>','2.42 acre lot','<p>	<span style="color: black;">The Alexion Pharmaceuticals Building at 100 College Street impresses with a strikingly modern glass exterior that boasts a rectangular protruding structure on its side facing College Street. On the street level, the building intentionally invites passersby walking along MLK Boulevard – the more pedestrian-friendly crossing street compared to South Frontage – by elongating and pivoting its entrance from the middle of the block all the way to the corner. Nevertheless, there are various access points and ramps up to the entrance level though the principal entrance is marked by the building’s address in an elegant font atop a sleek overhanging awning. Still, the uniquely modern design and relatively outstanding size of the Alexion Building – excluding the Knights of Columbus landmark standing two blocks to its southeast – can induce a sense of exclusion in pedestrians, marking a tension between these conflicting elements of the building. Nevertheless, the structure’s most notable feature is the prominent glass façade of the College Street-facing section of the building. Entirely made of glass, the façade possesses an acute indentation towards the building’s top, creating a dynamism and punctured angularity that fits with the structure’s modern style. This projecting front structure contains two staggered sections with the base portion extending furthest to the street. This architectural feature creates balconies at the meeting points of the low, middle, and upper sections, creating an impression on a distant viewer that the façade is uniformly flat. Once more, this contrast notes the particularity and uniqueness of Elkus Manfredi’s architectural design especially in its urban context at the intersection of the Downtown and Hill neighborhoods. Across the exterior of all four building sides, horizontal beams cut across vertical glass windows to form repeating squares and rectangles along the street-facing facades. However, the three sides that do not face College Street contain thicker horizontal bands – presumably of concrete – colored in a sand tone, further making the front façade distinct from those on the principal structure. Still, this relatively common architectural design gives the building a sense of order and regularity that establishes a balance between the structure’s uniform and ornate design elements. Furthermore, Alexion decided to adorn its logo on the top-right portion of the building’s College Street side, overlaying the company’s blue lettering on horizontally stacked steel lines to clearly differentiate this section from the glass façade below. This final contrast between the logo and the exterior’s transparent windows and silver steel beams adds a conclusive piece to the mosaic – or architectural puzzle – that is 100 College Street. Lastly on the interior, John Watts Associates primarily focused on providing the necessary yet distinct spaces for Alexion’s administrative, operational, and research branches within the building. As such, the interior establishes a certain spatial uniformity and repeating office form as per most corporate styles, yet uniquely utilizes the light brought in by the glass façades to foster a brighter and more inviting natural workspace.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>','<p>	<span style="color: black;">Erected above the edge of the failed Oak Street Connector, the Alexion Pharmaceuticals Building looks over the medley of thruways connecting to I-95, and stands between Downtown and the less developed Hill neighborhood. At the plan level, the building is rectangular in shape and takes up about one-fifth of the extended block bounded by South Frontage Road, MLK Jr. Boulevard, College Street, and Park Street --- York Street does not continue past MLK Jr. Boulevard. Today, to the immediate south of the site lies housing for the Yale School of Public Health and Yale School of Medicine, and to the west lies the Yale New Haven Hospital. Behind the structure on the block stands the immense Air Rights Garage, and two blocks north-west of the lot is the Cooperative Arts and Humanities High School – not far from where the Zunder School stood until Mayor Dick Lee’s Renewal Project of the 1950s.&nbsp;</span></p><p>	<span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p><p>	<span style="color: black;">Before the Oak Street Connector Project that began in the 1950s, the urban setting surrounding this site was principally low-income housing and small storefronts for immigrant workers. In this way, the area boasted a high density of activity as evidenced by a more chaotic layout of smaller, crossing streets that still partly remain in the Hill neighborhood. In the 1884, 1901, and 1924 Sanborn Maps, the area around the site of 100 College Street – then on Factory Street (tellingly named) between Oak St. and Commerce St. – was populated with tenements and boarding houses, small stores and clothing factories (such as the Newman and Sons Corset Factory), and Jewish synagogues and congregational buildings. Along with the visual context given by the Sanborn maps, newspaper articles mention that “the city’s first synagogues” were located in this area, and several published sources emphasize that various ethnic, racial, and religious groups lived in this location in relative harmony. One article notes, “Jew, Gentiles, and blacks lived as neighbors and had each others’ interests at heart,” whereas another first-hand account explains, “the neighborhood was a mix of totally integrated Jews, blacks, Poles, and Italians.” However, underlying this communal cooperation was a shared poverty and first-generation immigrant status that tainted their quality of lives.</span><a href="#_ftn1" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[1]</a><span style="color: black;"> </span></p><p>	<span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p><p>	<span style="color: black;">At the time that the Connector was built – the highway ending at York Street opened in the end of 1958 – much of the local population, infrastructure, and architecture was uprooted for the sake of the public project. This Route 34 initiative led to the displacement of 880 families, 350 demolished buildings, and the separation of Downtown from various neighborhoods, Union Station, and the Yale School of Medicine.</span><a href="#_ftn2" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[2]</a><span style="color: black;"> However, two principal nodes in the urban context persisted through this time of renewal: the Knights of Columbus Building – which sits one block west of 100 College Street – and the Southern New England Telephone Company – which occupied a plot of land on College Street around George Street.</span><a href="#_ftn3" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[3]</a><span style="color: black;"> Hence, for a significant period of time, this area became unwalkable and its urban dynamism almost entirely simmered down. If anything, such a change in the site’s urban history reflects the clear posturing of New Haven to the highway as a magnet of drawing in economic opportunity, and thus the elevation of economic potential as the determinant of city spaces. Today, 100 College Street is essentially being used for a similar purpose despite its increasingly different urban context. The property of 100 College Street represents a central element of the Downtown Crossing Project, a new redevelopment plan that aspires to connect Downtown, The Hill, Union Station, and Medical Campuses through a redefinition of public and pedestrian space over the remnants of Route 34. The 4-Phase plan looks to extend Orange Street to South Orange Street and Temple Street to Congress Avenue, create pedestrian and bicycle-friendly infrastructure, establish a public plaza, and reclaim ten acres of developable land from the former expressway’s right of way.</span><a href="#_ftn4" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[4]</a><span style="color: black;"> With this project, 100 College Street again stands at the heart of another urban planning movement in New Haven, and once more reflects the time’s particular economic (corporate office space development) and social (pedestrian, green space) focuses. While the tension during the Oak Street Connector days centered on the displacement of communities for “public” highway access, the albeit less pronounced strain today rests in the different styles and focuses promoted by the citizenry versus those of corporate entities like Alexion. Though this redevelopment project is less destructive than that of Route 34, the debate of public versus private space should evermore and continue to be alive today. All in all, in looking ahead to the future, the urban context surrounding 100 College Street is not entirely uncertain given the renderings and practical undertakings of those leading the Downtown Crossing Project. Nevertheless, if New Haven’s history is suggestive of any reality then any urban initiative must be scrutinized and understood as theoretical until its completion.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>','<p><br></p><p>	The social history of the site pairs directly with the developments of its urban context. As noted above, this area served as a melting pot for workers that lived in New Haven for its economic promise. Though many described the area as vibrant and its residents as largely cooperative and harmonious, others more bleakly portrayed the neighborhood as run-down, dangerous, and underserved by the public. Several first-hand newspaper accounts reject any sanctimoniously praiseful recollections of this Oak Street area, instead describing the busy area as ridden with social ills. One article harshly and bluntly states, “how they can look back nostalgically on Oak Street is totally incomprehensible to me. Oak Street was a rat-trap, the worst kind of slum.” That same source critically notes the area’s uncharacteristically high infant mortality rate, its sparsity of electricity, and its high risk of fire due to usage of kerosene lamps by residents.<a href="#_ftn1" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[1]</a> Nevertheless, the decision to raze large sections of this Oak Street neighborhood necessarily eliminated the potential for constructive change within the community. Instead, this neighborhood of incredible diversity both ethnically and racially -- demographically, a map shows equal rates of white and black renters in the area – was destroyed for a project that theoretically aspired to better connect peoples travelling into New Haven by car.<a href="#_ftn2" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[2]</a> However, the failure of the initiative begs the question of whether any aspect of the project was worthwhile. As Mayor Dick Lee stated after the Oak Street Connector Project’s termination, “the Oak Street Connector is now a liability rather than an asset… (the area) has become a ghost city. The streets have become blighted and the adjacent properties abandoned. The long delay by the state created a series of problems and destroyed morale in the neighborhood affected.”<a href="#_ftn3" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[3]</a> Today, the site is once again part of the Downtown Crossing Project, and thus hopes to promote a sense of social and economic dynamism that was lost by the Connector project decades ago. The development of 100 College Street and the attraction of Alexion Pharmaceuticals as the tenant together effectively and efficiently infuse the community with both economic and social activity. Whereas the site used to be vacant, today 100 College Street occupies about 450 individuals, and in turn serves as a new working hub for peoples of various ethnic, racial, and intellectual backgrounds. All in all, the social history of the site is one of three distinct phases ranging from peak activity to dissolution to reemergence, and its future only looks more promising as New Haven’s economic and urban landscapes continue to grow.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>','<p><span style="color: black;">The site of 100 College Street has a fairly complex history even though the plot’s first structure at this address was constructed just three years ago. As per the 1886, 1900, and 1924 Sanborn Maps, 100 College Street did not exist as an address since College Street ended at George Street. In the 1886 Sanborn Map, the site would approximately be located on Factory Street between Oak Street and Commerce Street though no structures stood on this block. In the 1901 map, the site was filled by several unnamed stores, the Congregation Bikur Cholin B’Nai Abraham, and a junkyard. Such a density of structures within the Alexion plot reflects the difference in urban planning and activity throughout New Haven’s history. On the periphery of the site, the 1901 Map shows various tenement buildings and two structures occupying cobblers. By the time of the 1973 Map, College Street had been extended down George Street to Congress Avenue; however, the Oak Street Connector Project had leveled the web-like series of Rose Street, Rose Court, Gilgry Avenue around Factory Street in addition to the adjacent area of Oak Street westward from Orange Street. From New Haven records, 100 College Street was the first structure on this site between South Frontage Road and MLK Jr. Boulevard, and it was sold to WE 100 College Street LLC on 5/31/2013. Once more, the structure was completed in 2015, and Alexion Pharmaceuticals began its operations there in 2016. By the end of 2016, this property spanning 2.42 acres was appraised at a total value of $158,390,300 and assessed for a total value of $110,873,210.</span><a href="#_ftn1" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[1]</a><span style="color: black;"> Lastly, Alexion announced that the company is moving its headquarters to Boston but maintaining 100 College Street as a research and development center. Thus, though the future of the site was put into question with Alexion’s decision, the site’s outlook seems bright with Alexion’s clarified continued presence. All in all, the site of 100 College Street itself tells a microcosmic story of its block, neighborhood, and city from namelessness to nonexistence to prominence. </span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>');

The building is located on a busy Whalley street that has citizens passing by throughout the day and night, with shops and stores only a few blocks down the street. The building plays the role of an intriguing housing unit situated in a very dense and lively part of town where the people living here would be more outgoing or those that wish to be close to everything.</p>','<p>Royal O. Dorman moved from 158 York street once the completion of 43 Whalley was complete. The building was built in 1885 for Dorman, who was a carriage manufacturer at that time (3). Dorman was the first tenant of this building and little is known about why it was created for him as stated in the New Haven Land Records and city directories. Whalley street area was dominated by late 19<sup>th</sup> century and early 20<sup>th</sup> century residential and commercial structures (1). So, when the next owner of the building, Lee Hongman (no information is known about Benson, Crum, or Hampson’s time as tenants of this building), used the building for residential and commercial purposes it fit amongst the ever-growing street of commercialism. Little is known about how long Hongman owned the building except that up to 1983, when the National Preservation Archive took note of the building different aspects and history, he was the sole owner (1). Though eventually the building came to be owned by Yale and is rented out to college students and others in New Haven through the Elm Campus Partners company (2).&nbsp;</p>','<p>(1) Connecticut Historical Commission, <em>Historic Resources Inventory Document</em>, 3874</p><p><a href="about:blank" target="_blank">file:///C:/Users/paula/OneDrive/Documents/Building%20Preservation%20archive%20file.pdf</a> </p><p><br></p><p>(2) “Elm Campus Partners – 43 Whalley Avenue,” Elm Campus Brothers, accessed on February 20<sup>th</sup>, 2018, <a href="http://www.elmcampus.com/apartments/Broadway/43Whalley/" target="_blank">www.elmcampus.com/apartments/Broadway/43Whalley/</a>.</p><p><br></p><p>(3) Trade News Publishing Company of New York, <em>The Automotive Manufacturer, Volume 37</em>, 828</p><p><br></p><p>(4) Sanborn Map Company of New York, Atlas of New Haven 1911, <em>Sanborn Insurance Map</em>, Plate 8, 1911</p><p><br></p><p>(5) Sanborn Map Company of New York, Atlas of New Haven 1923, <em>Sanborn Insurance Map, </em>Plate 22, 1923</p>','Unknown','<p>There is little known site history prior to the building of the Royal O.

It was built in 1908 for Yale University as part of an initiative to increase laboratory buildings on campus. At that time, most of the surrounding land on Hillhouse avenue belonged to the Sheffield Estate, evident from the presence of the magnificent Joseph Sheffield House down the street from Leet Oliver Memorial Hall (2). Today, the building is in use by Yale’s Mathematics Department and contains offices and classrooms. It also houses the Yale Mathematics Library on the top floor. The name is often abbreviated to “LOM.”</span></p>','3 + B','70 x 100','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Leet Memorial Hall is built of primarily white, Indiana limestone. It also has some brick and a steel frame (1). The style is late Gothic revival of the early 20th century. This is evident in the gabled roof, parapets lining small platforms beneath the third story windows, and pointed arches above the windows. It also has an arched entrance at the base of a central bay under a small frontal gable. The roof is gabled and made of tile (3). </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The architect, Charles Haight, is often credited with bringing the collegiate Gothic style to Yale’s campus. He designed many other buildings on Yale’s campus in this era, including Vanderbilt Hall, Phelps Hall and archway, and Mason Laboratory, among others (4).</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The building has only undergone minor interior renovations since being built, the most notable being in 2007 when new lighting, ADA adaptations, and interior finishes were added to common areas, classrooms and rest rooms. Audio-visual features were installed (5).</span></p><p><br></p>','<p>The building has been under the ownership and use of Yale University since being built in 1908.</p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Leet Oliver Memorial Hall is located on the lower block of Hillhouse avenue, a tree-lined street containing primarily Yale University buildings of diverse and beautiful styles. Charles Dickens described the street as “the most beautiful street in America.” The second block of Hillhouse avenue belongs to the Hillhouse historical district, and this beauty and history is evident in the buildings neighboring LOM as well as in LOM itself (6). </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Leet Oliver Memorial Hall is built below street level, as the ground slopes up steeply in this area. The Farmington Canal trail, a popular path for runners, bikers, and walkers, passes underneath Hillhouse Avenue next to LOM. Dunham Laboratory, another Gothic style laboratory building, lies to the left of Leet Oliver Memorial hall and is connected to LOM by a glass bridge from the fourth floor of Dunham to the third floor of LOM. No exact date for the construction of the bridge has been found, but it must have been built after 1958, when Dunham Laboratory was renovated and expanded.</span></p><p><br></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Leet Oliver Memorial Hall was built with money donated by Mrs. James Brown Oliver in memory of her son, Daniel Leet Oliver. Daniel Leet Oliver passed away in June 1907, right after his junior year at Yale, while driving back from a Yale-Harvard ball game with some friends. He is buried in his hometown of Pittsburgh (4, 7).</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The building was part of Yale’s initiative to increase laboratory and scientific buildings on campus. Leet Oliver Memorial Hall is one of nine laboratory buildings that were built on Hillhouse avenue in the first quarter of the 20th century. Also among them are Mason Laboratory and Dunham Laboratory. From its inception, Leet Oliver Memorial Hall was primarily a classroom building rather than a scientific laboratory, but it was nonetheless part of Yale’s expanding science curriculum. The building was in use by Sheffield Scientific School, Yale’s school of science and engineering. Sheffield was originally very small and poor, with annual tuition costing only $30, but the construction of these new buildings enable Sheffield to increase it’s enrollment by 1000 students by 1913 (2).</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Throughout the first half of the 19th century the Sheffield Scientific School gradually dissolved, as Bachelor of Science degrees were transferred to Yale College and graduate students began to cluster towards the School of Engineering. In 1945, the Sheffield Scientific School officially became a part of Yale College. Nevertheless, Leet Oliver Memorial Hall remained a scientific building through this transition (2, 8).</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Today, Leet Oliver Memorial Hall is home to the Yale Mathematics Department. It contains offices, classrooms, and the Yale Mathematics Library.</span></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Leet Oliver Memorial Hall is built on land formerly belonging to the Sheffield Estate and the history of LOM, along with the Sheffield Scientific School, is closely linked to that of the Sheffield Estate. The Sheffield Estate used to take up much of the land on Hillhouse avenue, but as Yale and the Sheffield Scientific School expanded, they bought up the land from the Sheffield family (2).</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Sheffield Estate used to contain the Sheffield Mansion. The Sheffield Mansion was originally built in 1836, by Ithiel Town, who used the building to store his large collection of architectural books (the largest such collection in America at the time). The building was an architectural beauty: a Greek Revival House reminiscent of Monticello. In 1957, Henry Austin heavily remodeled the building for Joseph Sheffield, giving it Italianate elements. When LOM was built in 1908, the Sheffield Mansion still stood next door. It remained there through the construction of Dunham Laboratory in 1912, but was razed in 1957 to enable renovations and extensions to be made to Dunham Laboratory (2). By this time, the land on Hillhouse avenue surrounding LOM all belonged to Yale University. Today, every building on the street except for St. Mary’s Church is owned by Yale University (6).</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">There is some confusion on Sanborn maps and city atlas’ from the time with names of buildings. The building next door to LOM is often labeled “Biological Laboratory.” However, no record exists of this building, and it is in the same shape and location as other buildings labeled as the Sheffield Mansion (9, 10, 11).</span></p>','<p>1) Historic Resources Initiative, Buildings and Structures.”<em> Connecticut Historical Commission</em>.

The front entrance is disrupted by the systematically dispersed window crevices that contain plain frames and elaborate stained glass. There is a notable entry tower with a semi-grand steeple and transepts, each containing a strengthening crossbar with intricate accents. Both sides of the church incorporate these narrow window frames further adding to the Romanesque architectural tradition. The church is currently vacant, but it still part of the larger, five building Sacred Heart Campus which includes the rectory, convent, school, and garage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>','59.1 ft x 118.3 ft','<p><span style="color: black;">Diocese of Hartford (1874-2018) Sacred Heart Parish (1874-2009)</span></p>','<p>Visually, Sacred Heart Church is a bold, 2.5 story building with a 3 story tower accented with a stone cross (1). In addition, there is an enlarged nook to hold a statue in the back of the church. The brickwork is made up of square-cut brownstones while the roof is lined with slate tile (1). The front exterior of the church has three tall, half-curved windows with embellished stained glass while the either side of the church has multiple, perfectly aligned window apertures where the braiding decoration is visible. It should be noted that the earlier cornice Italian-style molding was later altered to a plainer and timeless design in the early 2000s (2). The picturesque style of the church was still kept in mind as the add-ons were built to be a continuation of the Romanesque-style church. The church building design is practical, yet at the same time quite striking in its delivery. </p><p>&nbsp;</p>','<p>Sacred Heart Church is in a residential neighborhood with substantial family housing densely surrounding the property. The church compound is positioned on the southernmost edge of the Hill Urban Renewal area with the Lee High School to the north, Church St. Square Renewal space to the east, and the elderly residential area of Hill neighborhood to the west (1). From the pictures, it is obvious to see that there is serious deterioration of the neighborhood in general, as the houses surrounding the church are a mixture of small single, and multi-family homes. In addition, there is a decently busy business with a compact parking lot located across the street, however, for the most part, the area is a quiet neighborhood with few cars passing. There is a significant lack of green on the entire block and the sidewalks look considerably aged. The landscape is what one would typically imagine of an abandoned building; brown, uncut and, overall, neglected.&nbsp;</p>','<p>Since its establishment as a Congregational church in 1852, Sacred Heart church has continuously been in the private ownership of the diocese of Hartford (2). Father Stephen P. Sheffrey was the first pastor of the parish before then being passed down to Father John A. Mulcahy just six years later (2). Throughout its time as a holy site, Sacred Heart expanded its site due to popular demand and exceptional growth of the neighborhood by adding a rectory, convent, school, as well as a garage (3). It was Father John who agreed to the purchasing of more land along Columbus Avenue in order to establish a school and convent (2). After this purchase, the entire block began to densify and become a place of social gathering as well as education as seen in the Sanborn maps. In the maps, it is evident by the growth of houses (yellow buildings) that sprung up around the church that it was an important piece of the neighborhood’s social culture (4,5,6). There was an addition made to the church in 1888, the opening of a school in 1895 as well as a new convent in 1897 (2). There was a fire that engulfed the church in 1939 that required some restoration, but was not particularly substantial (2).&nbsp;</p><p>	</p><p>The church did not necessarily have tenants, but it was the people that made up the parish that instituted the social climate. It was a place of gathering and a centralized establishment that drew a diverse group of people to a commonplace to worship and connect. For instance, during the 1890s, Father McKeon’s parish tallied close to 5,000 people (2). Throughout his pastorate, there were a plethora of activities that members of the parish could take part in including societies, clubs, sports, and missions (2). Each of these activities was open to a wide range of ages, created an inviting environment in the city’s social history and founded a welcoming presence that evoked the importance of community. The continuation of expansion of the Sacred Heart parish offers an interesting explanation to the social culture at the time, hinting at the popularity of the middle-class religious movement as well as its’ collaboration with education. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>It is unfortunate that the current structure appears to be uninviting and abandoned, a sharp contrast to what once stood as the empowering center of neighborhood gathering. Instead of being a building that was seen as an outreach to those around it, Sacred Heart Church is now an unattached and abandoned structure that has lost its powerful social importance within the community and influence over the neighborhood’s residents. The building provided a service that fulfilled member’s spiritual needs, but now sadly, has left the general neighborhood and the former members of its parish spiritually hungry. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>','<p>Sacred Heart Church was built in 1854 in part of the gracious funding by Gerard Hallock and Thomas Trowbridge (1). The building served as the South Congregational Church until the mid 1860s before the Howard Ave. Congregational Church was built in its place (1). Throughout the 1900s, the building was a clearly established as an important center in the area (see picture captions in the 1886, 1901, and 1923 Sanborn maps below: 4,5,6). &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The property was abandoned after Sacred Heart Parish community was reassigned to St. Anthony Parish, now located on Washington Avenue, in September, 2009 (3). The property was sold to St. Martin de Porres Academy in 2009 (3). The two sites converged due to the decline in parishioners and to avoid the duplication of services (3).&nbsp;</p>','<ol><li>Maynard, Preston.

The massive brick-and-concrete structure offers a few ornamental details, including a handful of neoclassical columns and a Tudoresque glass front, but generally its effect is more functional than beautifying. It exists to avert a food desert; looking pretty is beside the point. Positioned on the remains of Whalley’s former “automobile row,” Stop &amp; Shop now provides fresh and accessible food to Dwight neighborhood residents and Yale students alike.</p>','<p>Like many superstores, Stop &amp; Shop strikes the viewer with a sense of sheer mass. Its single enormous story dominates the space, stretching broadly across the ground, towering over pedestrians and threatening to swallow them. For a building meant to feed people, it’s not very friendly — but its very unfriendliness suggests the cornucopia stocked within.</p><p>Beyond the heavy massing, every architectural choice appears to have been made in the interest of warmth. Red brick textures the endless walls; porticoes shelter the carts and customers; at the center of the building’s front, where people enter through sliding doors, projects a structure shaped like the face of a Greek temple. Framed by spare columns and the suggestion of a pediment, it ornaments modern utility with Classical character — though the warm brick swings the overall impression more toward Colonial Revival. The rest of the face is patterned with rectangular glass panels set in a dense green lattice, faintly evoking Tudor half-timbering while reflecting the sky and the parking lot, relieving some of the structure’s weight. The sides of the building are interspersed with similar ornaments: green beams and glass panels, some painted opaque; open pediments and Tuscan columns, some sealed to the walls like buttresses.</p><p>Visible security cameras are mounted to the exterior. A sign on one stanchion tells shoppers that their carts will lock if taken beyond the parking lot perimeter, preventing theft. Occasionally, a few lines of graffiti scrawl across the low metal fence separating the building from the sidewalk.</p><p>In 2012, the City of New Haven approved the installation of a Stop &amp; Shop-affiliated gas station at the edge of the parking lot, providing an extra utility within easy reach of shoppers (1).</p>','<p>Stop &amp; Shop is nestled between Whalley and Elm, just east of Orchard, between many other retail spaces housed in boxy concrete buildings. It anchors Dwight Place, a shopping center sponsored by the Greater Dwight Development Corporation. For many Dwight neighborhood residents and Yale students, it’s the only supermarket accessible by foot — especially important, since many of its customers don’t own cars. As such, it’s a vital source of reasonably priced food; without Stop &amp; Shop, many people would have to drive, bike, or take the bus to shop for produce. Given that the Dwight neighborhood is more densely populated than downtown New Haven, the supermarket serves a critical need.</p><p>The streetscape, however, is not ideal. Nearly two decades after the building’s construction, Whalley Avenue — a street with four lanes and plenty of traffic — still lacks a crosswalk anywhere near the store, and the towering façade, set barely a yard back from the sidewalk, squeezes pedestrians toward the racing cars. Again, the design is decidedly unfriendly (2). Maybe such a critical resource doesn’t need to be friendly to be useful, but when the Greater Dwight Development Corporation claims that it provides “a shopping experience for New Haven usually found in the upscale suburbs" (3), one expects the street design to do better.</p>','<p>The building at 150 Whalley was constructed in July 1998 to house Shaw’s Supermarket, a grocery chain operated by Albertsons and later SuperValu. The opening of Shaw’s followed the combined efforts of grassroots organizations, Yale University, the Hospital of St. Raphael, the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, the Greater Dwight Development Corporation, and a host of other private and public investors to bring a full-scale supermarket to the inner city. While in operation, Shaw’s supplied the surrounding area with fresh and accessible food and hired more than a hundred New Haven residents (4).</p><p>In February 2010, SuperValu announced that it would close its Connecticut grocery stores. The majority of its locations were sold to other chains, but no buyer emerged for the Shaw’s on Whalley Avenue (5). The store became a ghost town, and in late March closed down entirely (6). Neighborhood leaders immediately launched into action, campaigning to attract new buyers, fighting to stave off the impending food desert (7). In February 2011, following efforts by professional developers, lawyers, investors, Yale students, and community organizations, Stop &amp; Shop closed a deal to fill the vacancy (8). On April 15, the new store opened its doors to fanfare, giving jobs to 150 New Haven residents (9) and providing fresh produce to customers who’d struggled to access it in the last year (10).</p><p>Despite the triumph of this Stop &amp; Shop’s very existence, the store is troubled by allegations of poor management. Yelp users complain of long lines, old meat, and shortages of shopping carts and plastic bags (11). While some of the complaints amount to little more than unvarnished elitism (“Take a look at the people who go here and you\'ll know why [the service is so bad]”), understaffing and understocking are genuine problems — especially since the Stop &amp; Shop is supposed to serve its neighborhood by hiring residents and providing access to a full range of fresh foods.</p>','<p>Whalley Avenue, a radial highway branching off New Haven’s central grid, was established around 1797 (12). By the late 1800s, the land around its intersection with Orchard had developed into a residential neighborhood replete with Italianate and Neoclassical houses. A neighboring livery and carriage shop tended to transportation, otherwise allowing private homes to dominate the space (13).</p><p>But horses and carriages weren’t long for the modern world. By 1913, while the livery and accompanying veterinarians remained, the first automobile agency had appeared (14), and within the next ten years, the livery vanished, replaced by auto shops and repair companies, as well as several filling stations for the cars. Some houses were further uprooted to make way for giant concrete garages that each held up to 80 vehicles (15). As the automobile revolutionized American transportation, accelerating movement and shrinking distances, Whalley Avenue changed to meet the revolution’s demands. Not even the Great Depression could stem the shifting tide: in 1939, there were more car shops than ever (16). Through the mid-20th century, Whalley Avenue came to host a panoply of dealers, supplying Fords and Buicks and Chevrolets, Dodges and Lincolns and Cadillacs, tire shops and repair services, multiple exchanges for used cars (17) (18). The area came to be known as “automobile row" (19), and the old rows of houses, set quaintly upon the street, were demolished to clear the way for it (20).</p><p>By the late 1970s, however, Whalley’s auto row was withering. Amidst rising crime, Ford, Pontiac, and Chevrolet “fle[d] to suburbia in droves.” Their lots were filled by fast food emporiums and nightclubs or else left vacant for years (21). In the early 1980s, the community strove to restore the district with help from city funding (22) (23), but by the 1990s, they shifted to seeking a grocer to fill the vacancies. In 1996, Yale University and the Dwight Community Management Team won a $2.4 million federal grant to fund economic development in university towns, later supplemented by an additional $6 million from Yale, and part of the money was funneled into the development of a major supermarket (24).

It is in the gothic style. An outdoor path running through the building leads up to Weir Court, the building’s courtyard that has been appropriated as the university’s sculpture garden.</p><p>	In 1912 George Douglas Miller set out to build a dormitory for Skull and Bones, but quickly ran out of money (2). After 1914, it lay abandoned for ten years until Yale’s architecture department made use of it. Today, the building is part of Jonathon Edwards College taking on the roles of dormitory, library and dining hall kitchen. Included in the building are the towers of (the now demolished) Old Alumni Hall (2). Originally built in 1851, they make up the third oldest structure on Yale’s campus (1).</p>','<p>Visible from the street only as a small façade, Weir Hall sits between the Skull and Bones tomb and Jonathan Edwards College. During the Yale Art Gallery’s hours, the outdoor path through the building is open to the public.&nbsp;It leads between the eastern wing of the building and its towers, up a set of stairs and to the building’s associated courtyard. There, the building is fully visible. It is of a gothic style and built of brownstone. From the south (within Weir court) it shows its delicacy with a windowed façade of large windows and pointed arches. From the north (within Jonathon Edwards College Courtyard) it is fortress-like, expressing the weight of its load-bearing masonry. The southern walls feature small windows and large, rough-cut stone.</p><p>The building is in good condition; however, Lichen covers portions of the exterior and the brownstone towers of Alumni Hall corrode by touch.</p><p>	Originally built to be a dormitory for Skull and Bones between 1912, the building was abandoned in 1914 (3). In 1924, Yale University completed the building to house the university’s architecture department (4). The building was finished according to the original architects’ plans with only slight adjustments to repurpose it as an academic building. In 1932, James Gamble Rogers altered the building, adding a tower to the (5). And in 1965, architect Charles Brewer redesigned the building to be used as a library and classroom-space for Jonathon Edwards College (6). In 2007, Weir Hall made its final transformation when Newman Architects completed the annexation process. The renovations transformed the basement into the Jonathon Edwards kitchen and the office spaces into student bedrooms. A glass rooftop hallway between the eastern and northern wings and smooth, light-brown sandstone evidence the 2007 renovation. </p><p>	The Courtyard has also had its fair share of changes. Originally, twenty-foot sandstone walls surrounded Weir Court (7).&nbsp;The Kahn-designed art gallery addition replaced the southern and eastern walls (8). Today some of those walls’ stones make up a bench, lining the courtyard. In 1975, Newman Architects built the Yale University Art Gallery’s auditorium beneath Weir Court, but managed to preserve the large shade-trees now occupying the site. Where a Chinese tea-house sits today originally sat the building’s driveway (its door into the basement has since been filled) (5).</p><p>	Within the building today, the library maintains its gothic style, featuring a series of vaulted ceilings and the stone of its exterior walls. In the stairwells, living spaces and kitchens are styled in a contemporary vernacular with white walls and concrete or hardwood floors.&nbsp;</p>','<p>	Set back from high street, Weir Hall is entirely enveloped in the Yale Campus. Originally, Weir court was meant as a retreat from the clamor of the city (1). Miller surrounded the court with 20 foot walls and raised it one story above the rest of the city (7). Abandoned and isolated, New Haven residents thought the building one of the most mysterious in New Haven. Today, Weir Court serves as one of the gallery’s sculpture gardens. In 1953, Louis Kahn’s addition to the Yale University Art Gallery opened the court to the court by replacing the stone wall in the south with its glass doors and windows (3). To its north and West is Jonathon Edwards College. To the east sits the clubhouse of the Skull and Bones society.</p>','<p>Miller constructed the building on previously unused land, save for an abandoned livery stable. As it sits in the center of the block, the property of Weir Hall and Court was an amalgamation of six separate residential private back lots (10).</p>','<p>	In 1912, Yale College Alumnus George Douglas Miller (1870), set out to recreate Magdalen College of Oxford University’s arched gates and courtyards in New Haven (3). He bought the towers of Old Alumni Hall (that was concurrently being demolished) and relocated them across high street. Miller also built a courtyard one story above ground level. However, in 1914, he ran out of money, leaving the building incomplete and selling it to Yale University (9). Between 1914 and 1924, the building lay empty, used mainly for storage and occasionally&nbsp;military training classes (9). Between that time, the building (at the time called, <em>The Miller Property</em>) earned a mysterious reputation. A 1924 alumni magazine article noted, “few people have ever seen this structure, which, behind barred doors and a high wall, occupied the center of the block… As a consequence, there has been much rumor and an air of mystery about it” (2). In 1924, the university’s architecture department moved in. They named it Weir Hall after the art department’s founding director (2). Many prominent architects passed through the building. Notably, modern architect Eero Saarinen, designer of Ingalls Rink, earned his degree in Weir Hall. Philip Johnson, designer of Kline Biology Tower, taught classes in the building (3). The building then became a library and dormitory for Jonathon Edwards College after the completion of Paul Rudolph’s Art and Architecture Building. Yale School of Art and Yale School of Architecture maintain their connection to Weir Court; every year, the schools hold their commencement ceremony in the picturesque sculpture garden.</p>','<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elizabeth Mills Brown, <em>New Haven, a Guide to Architecture and Urban Design </em>(New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1976), 125.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vincent Scully, <em>Yale in New Haven: Architecture &amp; Urbanism </em>(New Haven: Yale University, 2004).</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patrick Pinnell, <em>The Campus Guide, Yale University </em>(New York: Princeton Architectural Press, 1999), 43-48.</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“YALE DEPARTMENT TO SHIFT LOCATION: Architecture Building Will Be Situated On Miller Property,” <em>The Hartford Courant, </em>13 June, 1924, ProQuest.</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James Gamble Rogers, Weir Hall Floorplans (1932).</p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charles H Brewer, <em>Weir Hall Floorplans </em>(1964).</p><p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Insurance Maps of New Haven, </em>Connecticut (New York: Sanborn Map &amp; Publishing Company, 1923)</p><p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Insurance Maps of New Haven, </em>Connecticut (New York: Sanborn Map &amp; Publishing Company, 1973)</p><p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“NEW ARCHITECTURE BUILDING AT YALE: Weir Hall to Be Dedicated When University Opens Sept. 25,”<em> The Hartford Courant, </em>14 September, 1924, ProQuest.</p><p>10.&nbsp;<em>Insurance Maps of New Haven, </em>Connecticut (New York: Sanborn Map &amp; Publishing Company, 1973)</p>');

This extension which was added c1975 is highlighted by large oblong, rectangular-shaped windows which emphasize its modernism.&nbsp;The windows are rimmed in white which adds some ornamentation while keeping the classic simplicity more in theme with this part of the building. Despite recent renovations to the interior of this building which is now solely used as the residence of Yale’s sorority, Kappa Alpha Theta (Epsilon Tau Chapter), the exterior appears to be in a slightly deteriorated state which can be mainly attributed to wearing over time.&nbsp;The deterioration of the older portions of the building is especially evident when juxtaposed with the more modern, stone-laced attachment.&nbsp;</span></p>','<p><span style="color: black;">*&nbsp;From 1872-1928 building was primarily owned by one person, and used as a private home. </span></p><p><span style="color: black;">*&nbsp;Beginning in 1928, George M.

The entries are off-center and open from a tall stoop with cast-iron rails. The entry doors are paneled and have a thick, horizontal beam above.&nbsp;The doorframes themselves originally both were surrounded by a detailed segmental arch surround and a small hood with a shallow shed roof and incised console supports.&nbsp;However, as of 1975, The Theta House had a 2-story addition put in place which projects from the front. This is a rough-faced cinderblock construction with tall window openings and a recessed entry. It adds an element of urban-renewal and sophistication to an otherwise 18</span><sup style="color: black;">th</sup><span style="color: black;"> century and slightly old-fashioned upper-level building. This protruding addition now serves as the entrance for The Theta House and so it differs much from its “building twin” 279 Crown St.&nbsp;The door in this square-shaped, 2-story addition is made of steel and glass and resembles the entrance to a retail store or grocery store more than that of a home.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: black;">The most influential renovation this building has undergone was the addition of the 2-story masonry building c1975.&nbsp;The addition is square-shaped and has a very clean cut, modern style which is further emphasized by its long symmetrical windows which line the front of the building. &nbsp;The building which is made of a light sandstone brick protrudes out onto the sidewalk from the more rustic looking original 5 story masonry building.&nbsp;The material that was used to construct it and its overall presence on the street provides a sense of roughness to the otherwise fairly feminine and modern style of the addition.&nbsp;In regards to the interior of the building, when the 2-story addition was added, an elegant black-iron stair case was also added which wraps around the front addition of the building and connects those two stories to the upper part of the 5-story home using a simple black balcony.</span></p>','<p><span style="color: black;">When taking into consideration the interrelationship of the building and its surroundings, the mix-use neighborhood of 19</span><sup style="color: black;">th</sup><span style="color: black;"> century and early 20</span><sup style="color: black;">th</sup><span style="color: black;"> century buildings is quite evident; this was noted by documents in the New Haven Museum and it still holds today. &nbsp;This neighborhood has a history of seeing substantial renewal.&nbsp;Discussing the renovations done to The Theta House with Pike International, it was interesting to note that more renovations had been done to the interior than to the exterior; thus I take it that this may also be true of the neighboring buildings.&nbsp;So even though some renewal processes may disturb the original buildings slightly, I don’t believe there is reason to assume that the street and the buildings’ appearances have changed much over the years.&nbsp;If anything, renovations may have taken place on the interior, and ownership may have changed, but the overall urban setting has remained fairly the same.</span></p><p><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: black;">Furthermore, the setting of this house has a history of being seen as an ideal area of residency especially for people involved with Yale University since it is so close to the university and just one block away from the bustling Chapel St.&nbsp;If you are unfamiliar with Chapel St, it is a busy street which is home to many of the most frequented restaurants and shops within the New Haven area.&nbsp;Crown St however, provides an ideal location for Yale residencies and businesses because it is slightly off-path from the most heavily-trafficked streets in the surrounding New Haven grid so it has an added level of privacy and people visiting the area find more ease in navigating the streets. </span></p><p><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: black;">Compared to its neighboring buildings, The Theta House doesn’t particularly stand out.&nbsp;It is tall, but so is the twin Italianate constructed right next to it, and the other Italianate buildings that line the block all provide a slightly imposing, ominous presence on the street as well.&nbsp;However, the one distinction of the Theta House that sets it apart from the others is the stone addition in the front which protrudes from the original building and who’s unique style makes it an anomaly on this street.</span></p>','<p><strong style="color: black;">Research conducted by Christine Chow in 2008</strong></p><p><br></p><p><em style="color: black;">“277 Crown Street was constructed in 1872, and from 1872-1928, the estate and building was primarily owned by one person, and used as a private home. Beginning in 1928, George M. Clarke transformed it into a lodging house. From 1941-1959, the building has changed owners various times, offering furnished rooms for people. When A. Bunten owned the building, she was ordered to alter the tenement house by the Building Inspectors. Thus, she improved the exit fire escape facilities by constructing a new balcony on the 2nd floor level in the rear. From 1959 – 1964, the building was left vacant until Angelo Cavaliere occupied the space in 1963. He began to erect a masonry 1-story addition, which included a new steel platform, catwalk, and masonry fence, at the rear of the existing structure.</em></p><p><br></p><p><em style="color: black;">The following year, Cavaliere erected a 2-story masonry vestibule addition in the front of the existing structure. Within this vestibule, a new framed stairway was added to the front exits of the second, third and fourth floors. Additionally, he altered the ground floor for his beauty salon, the Angelo’s Salon of Beauty. The remaining floors were occupied by various tenants. During 1970 – 1980, approximately eight tenants lived in the building at the same time. After 1980, the number of tenants had fallen from eight to two. From 1986 - 1987, Farricielli took over and made interior alterations and repairs to the beauty parlor. He also converted the housing into four dwelling units. In 1993, Farricielli opened a Hair and Skin Studio on the ground floor, while two occupants lived on the upper floors. From 2005-2007, America’s Best Promotional, a company that makes advertising promotional products, took over the ground floor business. Variant 13, an alternative clothing store, then briefly occupied the ground floor from 2007 -2008. As of 2015, Pike International rents the building as multiple one bedroom apartments.”</em></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: black;">I did not have access to Chow’s sources, however I was able to confirm much of her research through internet searches, phone calls (to Pike International!) and visits to the New Haven Museum (they had records that Angelo and his wife Margaret Cavaliere were the primary owners of the building c1960).&nbsp;At the New Haven Museum, I was also able to get an image of the building that was taken in 1981 and in which the sign on the front seems to confirm it is a private residence.&nbsp;Additionally, a photograph currently available on the NHBA, and attached to the bottom of this document confirms that between 2005-2007 the building was used by the company, America’s Best Promotional Products.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: black;">As is evident, The Theta House has a history of being used as mostly a residential building, thus many of its past-tenants were private home-owners.&nbsp;Of note is that the lower levels have been used for retail purposes in the past as well (ie: Angelo’s Salon of Beauty and America’s Best Promotional).&nbsp;However, after Pike International took ownership of the property in 2015, the purpose of the building has changed from that of a private home/very public business to something more in between the two.&nbsp;Today it is known as the Theta House and it is home to eight of the board members of the Epsilon Tau Chapter of Kappa Alpha Theta, but it is also open to all members (past, present, and future) of the sorority and friends of the sorority who wish to visit.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: black;">Since being established as the Theta House, this building has adapted a new meaning with an underlying rich history.&nbsp;Kappa Alpha Theta is the world’s first women fraternity, and this is their first official space on Yale’s campus. Now, current and past Thetas all have a place to gather and embrace their sisterhood and celebrate the accomplishments of the women before them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p>','<p><span style="color: black;">As mentioned above, this neighborhood has historically been used for mainly residential and retail purposes and it has always been known as a prime location given its closeness (just one block away) to the Yale campus and Chapel Street.&nbsp;Past ownership was also covered under the Social History section.&nbsp;There is not much to add in regards to the site history that has not already been previously discussed in a section above.</span></p>','<p><span style="color: black;">1980 Historic Resources Inventory Building and Structures – Connecticut Historical Commission, Done by the New Haven Preservation Trust.

Mirroring the cottage qualities of the Downing residences, its rustic feel still serves to welcome visitors off the highway into the loftier buildings of Yale.

The façade on Temple Street has a long one-story wing, which could have originally been a porch but no longer serves as such (2). The main room of the house has a one-story octagonal bay window. The entrance on Temple is plain. On Trumbull, the French doors have projecting cornices on brackets with pendants. The upper windows are plain.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Inside, the main room is large and open, home to many Yale-China Association events, with seating on the octagonal bay window looking out onto Berzelius and Whitney Avenue. Yale-China renovated this room within the past ten years (1). The Trumbull Street side of the house has a small office space. Upstairs, more typical office space houses various Yale-China purposes</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>The Yale University Building Plans show the complex inside space of Yale-China, which resulted from its add-ons. In these plans the two intricate sets of stairs are visible, one in the back by the first floor kitchen and one in the center by the main hall. The stairs also lead downstairs to a spacious basement with an oil burner and lots of storage space that Yale-China uses (5).&nbsp;</p>','<p>(1)&nbsp;Chapman, Nancy (Former Executive Director of the Yale-China Association).

Yale used to call it a “gateway” building, and as such, they immaculately preserved 442 Temple’s shingled exterior and Italianate porches even as the inside deteriorated (1). It is situated on a block on which Yale owns every building with the exception the Mormon church adjacent to the Yale-China Association. It looks out onto the commercial Whitney Avenue but sits across from uniquely Yale buildings such as the Berzelius tomb. Its bright red exterior contrasts with the monumental, neoclassical style across the street. The building is interestingly situated at the intersection of residential property on Temple Street, commercial property on Whitney, and Yale’s property, with a hodgepodge of architectural styles and building uses.&nbsp;</p>','<p>Built in 1851 for A.A. Thompson, a partner in Thompson &amp; Peckham tailors, the house at 442 Temple St. has served a variety of purposes (2). After Thompson moved out, the house was the home of Yale elocution professor Mark Bailey from 1869-1914. In 1928, his family sold it to Yale University, who used it as mixed office space until 1965. In 1965, it became home to a variety of student groups and to Yale’s janitorial staff (2). Many of these groups, like the Yale-China Association, had been displaced from the offices of the Berkeley Quadrangle, which was razed to make room for Berkeley College in the 1930s (1). The Yale-China Association’s temporary home at 442 Temple has slowly become permanent. Originally, the Yale-China Association shared the first-floor space with the Office for International Students and Scholars (OISS), and the janitorial staff used the second floor. When the janitorial staff relocated, Yale-China was in the midst of expansion and applied to Yale to get the upstairs portion. When Yale OISS relocated down the street on Temple, Yale-China got full use of the building (1).&nbsp;</p><p>What is now the Yale-China Association was founded as the Yale Foreign Missionary Society in 1901 in a bout of religious fervor on Yale’s campus. Quickly, it became focused on educational, rather than evangelical tasks (9). Over the course of much political change in China, the Yale-China Association adapted and now works on cultural understanding between Yale and China (8). The Yale-China Association uses 442 Temple St. as its main offices for such work and also as a place to host events such as Lunarfest for the Chinese New Year.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The Yale-China Association has a lengthy history with this building and has seen it through many changes. Though the house was always pristinely maintained on the exterior because of its proximity to the highway and the building’s role as a “gateway” to campus, the building had been subject to Yale’s “deferred maintenance” practice (1). Deferred maintenance allowed very basic surface repairs to the interior of buildings. Thus, the Yale-China Association itself was responsible for much of the interior renovations of the the 1990s. The main room now serves as a home to Yale-China artifacts and a meeting space for the Yale-China Association.&nbsp;</p>','<p>Before the construction of the building in 1851, the intersection of Temple and Trumbull streets was home to Mrs. Apthorp’s School and Home for young ladies from 1825-38. The school was moved in 1838 so that New Haven could extend Temple Street. Since A.A. Thompson constructed his home, 442 Temple has been home to the current building, consistently but with additions (3).</p><p><br></p><p>Since the house was built, the intersection has become far less residential, with most buildings surrounding it now almost entirely owned by Yale (7). The 1911 Sanborn map shows mostly houses surrounding then Mark Bailey’s house, along with longstanding Yale buildings further down the block on Hillhouse.&nbsp;</p>');

The symmetrical cross section roofing forms into a rounded muscular framing of the building which is bookended by abstract wooden sunscreens that serve to intriguingly mask the glassy entrances. Within the long narrow building, one is drawn upwards by a linear central staircase which leads into open space of the top level, where the auditorium and library reside. It is here, in this warm and communal space, where the students and faculty of the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies engage in work or discussion, which may later continue in the classrooms and offices located on the lower levels. The aesthetic appeal of Kroon Hall is matched by its mission for sustainability. It stands as the most ecologically responsible building on Yale’s campus, and obtained Platinum Rating under the LEED certification system. </span></p>','68,800 sq. ft.','4','<p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Pierson Sage Boiler and Refrigeration Plant</span></p>','<p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The long and narrow rectangular structure of this young building is formed east to west on Prospect Street in order to minimize heat gain and maximize exposure to light and solar gain. The gable-like curved roofing is covered in solar photovoltaic panels that help contribute to the renewable energy sources provided in the structure, and the exterior sides are made up of Ohio sandstone, a familiar symbol of Yale’s architectural beauty. It’s interior lodge aesthetic is created from the Red Oak Wood paneling (from Yale’s Tourney forest) that defines the most picturesque study space found at the top level of the building. It feels modern and fresh, while retaining a stylistic mixture of a “cathedral nave and Connecticut barn”. The top floor uses the warmth of daylight coming in through the massive glass windows, and the tongue-and-groove vertical and horizontal red oak paneling to create a warm and airy ambiance, which feels both communal and peacefully quiet all at once. As one descends the central staircase to the lower floors lined with classrooms and offices, the presence of large swaths of exposed interior concrete create a nice contrast to the continued presence of red oak at every level. Perhaps the most striking characteristic of this building is found at both entrances. In front of the glassy facade, the fir louvres are laid out as a kind of mask for the building which makes Kroon Hall all the more enticing for the curious pedestrian who wishes to see what exists inside.</span></p>','<p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Nestled in a small plot of land up Prospect Street, </span><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(48, 48, 48);">Kroon Hall is set between two existing science buildings, The Osborn Memorial Laboratories and The Sloane Physics Laboratory. Sage Bowers Hall. It is surrounded by three exterior courtyards, which vary in size, level, and purpose. There is a small public entry courtyard facing west. To the north, there exists a medium-size private court which is shared with Sage-Bowers, Forestry and Environmental Studies’ homebase building. Finally, the semi public, large courtyard on the south, belongs to both Kroon Hall and the Osborn Laboratories. “The LEED Platinum building provides bright modern company for an Eero Saarinen building across the street in a neighborhood awash in dark, neo-Gothic edifices.” </span></p>','<p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Given that Kroon Hall was built less than a decade ago, since its construction, Yale’s School of Forestry and Environmental Studies has remained the sole owner of this building which has come to serve as a symbol of this graduate program’s mission to study and make positive impacts on the degradation that our environment is currently facing. The building of this hall was made possible by the generous collaboration of many people whose names are carved into one of the interior walls which can be seen as soon as you walk through the entrance facing Science Hill. This building has become a central location for the graduate students and faculty in the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. It is where classes are often held, groups come together to discuss projects, students meet with professors, undergraduates and graduates alike come to the nave to study, and important events within the program take place here. What makes this building so important in the context of architectural history, is it’s representation of what we are capable of achieving in the future. It has received numerous awards and accolades for its attention to sustainable design, and as the greenest building on Yale’s campus, it is a strong example of what direction the future of architecture should be heading in. </span></p>','<p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Prior to Kroon Hall’s construction, this site belonged to the old Pierson-Sage Boiler and Refrigeration Plant. Before a newer, more centrally located campus plant could produce lines to bring up to Science Hill, the Pierson-Sage Plant served this part of the campus, starting in the early twentieth century. Once it was no longer needed, it was torn down to make way for the building of Kroon. An even longer look back into the history of this site takes one back to the 1890s.

Originally built in 1868 as the residence of John M. Davies, a prominent New Haven businessman, this structure has since been occupied by the Culinary Institute of America, and now, Yale University (8).</p><p>	While looking at the house, one struggles to absorb all of the intricate details of the facade and parse out the various design elements, such as the mansard roof and widow’s peak, but it would be difficult to miss the large, modern structure attached to the southern side of the house.&nbsp;Built in 2009 by Robert M. Stern, the Greenberg Conference Center is newly integrated with the Betts House (9).&nbsp;A small parking lot and the Yale Divinity School are located to the north of the house, the Greenberg Center to the south, and a grassy, sloping yard to the west.

In fact the entire neighborhood found around this lot was much different back in the early twentieth century. Areas of land were much more divided up, and instead of having large scale establishments crowding the streets, there were many small, modest businesses and homes found throughout (2). Although this area was cut into smaller sections and owned by many different people, it still had a ghost town type situation regarding it (7).

In the late 50’s the city found itself in a stage of growth and train voyage was found not to be a suffice method of travelling into the city (6). It was in this year when it was determined that a highway must be established to offer an easier and effective way for customers to travel and spend money in the city (7). The construction of the Oak Street connector called for many changes in the current standing city. This involved the clearing out a lot of city owned land including the school that sat on current 135 college street and even some private land where less well of individuals lived (6).</p><p>After construction concluded on this roadway in late 1958, early 1959, buildings and roads were then created to enhance its effectiveness.

On of the more important change came in 2004. It was in 2004 that a parking garage was added in the rear of this lot (3). This was a critical addition do the busyness of the city and also the lack of parking found in the city. The garage also may bring in a small bit of revenue to the land owners.</p>');

Finished in 1876, the chapel was a gift from Joseph Battell as well as other family members, providing space for daily chapel services at Yale (mandatory until 1926).</span></p><p>	<span style="color: black;">Lying between Durfee hall and Fanram hall, the building is designed with a High Victorian Gothic style of architecture made of rough brown New Jersey and Ohio Sandstone and blue Ohio sandstone for decorative elements. All three of these buildings were designed by the architect Russell Sturgis, Jr., which were undoubtedly the major achievements of his career, and were built with the purpose of separating Yale’s Old Campus from the rest of the city.</span></p><p>	<span style="color: black;">Currently, Battell Chapel is used for the Sunday services of the University Church at Yale University. During weekdays, it also serves the purpose of a classroom, concert hall, and a society hall for student meetings that can be accessed upon hours of the church.&nbsp;</span></p>','<p><span style="color: black;">Battell Chapel is a compact mass with a semi-circular projecting apse on College Street and twin towers on the west side. The towers at the west end of the chapel have tall, open stone-work lanterns and tall, ribbed conical roofs with finials and round turrets along their east sides. The walls are rusticated, and there are tall, slightly projecting transept arms near the east end. There is a one-story entrance porch with a pointed arch entrance facing Old Campus. In 1893, this side was altered with a gallery-high section that expanded the interior seating. The Elm Street side of the building still remains unaltered to this day.</span></p><p><span style="color: black;">Other entrances are slight gabled projections with pointed arch openings located on the north and south transepts, opposite to the Old Campus entrance on Elm Street. There is also a tall, square tower with paired, louvered vents and a pyramid roof at the south-east corner of the church on College Street. Each corner of the building is emphasized by buttresses and turrets as well. </span></p><p>	<span style="color: black;">On the face of the transept there is a large, gothic round window. A wall arcade with contrasting stone runs along the first level of the nave as well as around the apse on College Street; however, this feature was eventual removed to the face of the addition on the Old Campus side of the building. There is also a carved molding under the cornice with tall lancet windows made of leaded glass that mark the bays of the nave which was remolded in 1947 by Edward F. Euston.</span></p><p><br></p>','<p>Battell Chapel is located in the northeast corner of Yale’s Old Campus quadrangle 	<span style="color: black;">Inside the chapel, there are many memorials dedicated to alumni and faculty. Montomery Schuyler described the frescoed walls as “symphonic”, with the painted and gilded woodwork. Many of the windows are large, glass mosaics, depicting Yale related people and figures who played an important role in the university’s development. Surrounding the apse of the inside are many paintings, tall and skinny curved windows, and a large, triangular shaped organ that also runs along the left side of the chapel as well. In the main are there are many rows of church-styled seating as well as a second-floor gallery surrounding the ground level seating. The ceiling is lined with green panels with intricate wood-work in between, giving the interior a warm feel. Two chandeliers hang down from the center of the ceiling along with lights that file down the balcony which are the chapel’s main source of illumination. Schuyler further described Battell Chapel’s interior as “one of the most beautiful interiors to be found in the whole range of modern American church architecture.” (Brown, 10)</span>flanked by two other High Victorian Gothic (Farnam hall and Durfee hall). Yale’s Old Campus currently houses the majority of first-year students and has two other buildings: Lindsay Chittenden hall (classrooms) and Dwight hall (former ancient book library) in addition to the chapel.</p><p>As Old Campus used to house all students until 1933, it made sense to place the chapel on the yard, as it gave students easy access to a church whenever they needed it. Now, the chapel still gives students regular access to practice religion, as it is fairly close to the center of campus.</p>','<p>	The chapel has always been owned by Yale, as it was donated by Joseph Battell and his family. The overall design of the chapel appears to based on Keble College Chapel (Oxford), built by English Victorian architect William Butterfield. Battell Chapel was the result of a design competition held in 1866 as a memorial for students as well as alumni who died in the Civil War, which received attention in the British architectural journal, <u>The Builder</u>. </p><p>	While mandatory daily chapel services are no longer required at Yale (this was the main use for Battell Chapel before the early 20<sup>th</sup> century), the chapel still serves as a religious center for students on campus; however, it is also used for concerts (it is the main performance center for the Greater New Haven Youth Ensembles of Neighborhood Music School and the Greater New Haven Symphonic Wind Ensemble and Concert Band) as well as some of Yale’s student organizations. By making Battell Chapel open to the public through concerts and such, it allows the chapel’s use to go beyond just the Yale community and influence the rest of the New Haven population.</p>','<p>	Yale was first founded in 1701, and with their move to New Haven in 1718, Yale’s famous Old Campus was formed. As plans for Old Campus developed and expanded through the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> century, Yale President Noah Porter announced the removal of “old brick row” and the introduction of new dorms, starting with Farnam hall in 1870 (another building designed by Sturgis, Jr.). As these additions were made, Battell Chapel was also introduced to the area, no longer making Old Campus strictly for housing. The introduction of the new chapel gave the campus a new dimension and use for students and faculty as discussed in the “Social History” section above.</p>','<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Buildings and Grounds of Yale University</em>, 1979, p. 10.</p><p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;Brown, p. 124</p><p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;Papers of Carroll L.V.

Contrary to the commercial front that stands today, the 1850’s house was topped with a flared mansard roof, created in a Second Empire style. Flemish gabled dormers in heavily ornamented styles protruded from this roof in a much more extravagant fashion than the same do presently. Windows with decorated window heads and canted corners fell directly under the roof on the second floor. A portico ornamented the bottom story with columns and cornice and a large bay window was constructed on the north facing side of the building. After the building was purchased by Yale in 1935, Douglas Orr was tasked with remodeling the structure for commercial use. Most of the ornamentation was removed during this process and edges were straightened to give the building a simpler and more modern appearance. Glass bays were added to display commercial goods and encourage “window shopping”. Despite such changes to the building’s exterior, the present form of the building is not commercial. Elements of residential style are still apparent through the form of the second floor windows and dormers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>','<p>The southwest corner of Grove and Church streets houses a diverse mix of occupants. Several offices fill the area surrounding 258 Church Street. Yale has purchased the entirety of these buildings, using them as offices and service centers for a variety of departments. Directly west of 258 is the Yale residential college Timothy Dwight, housing Yale undergraduate students. The coffee and gift shop complex on the corner starkly contrasts with its surroundings in terms of function, yet it does not seem out of place. In both architectural style and commercial properties, 258 Church Street matches very closely with the buildings opposite it on the northeast corner of Grove and Church. In a sense, this building is simply an extension of the commercial district that is Whitney Avenue.&nbsp;</p>','<p>Madam Salisbury commissioned her house in 1850, on a lot that had previously been utilized as residential space. The Salisburys lived next door to the Woolseys, who resided directly south of what is presently 258 Church Street. Theodore Dwight Woolsey, the tenth president of Yale, eventually married the daughter of Madam Salisbury. In 1866, after Salisbury’s death, Henry White purchased the house. White graduated the Yale Divinity and Law School and established a successful probate and real estate firm. It is unclear whether or not White practiced out of 258 Church Street, but it is highly likely that much of his case work carried over into his home. Whites’ specialization in real estate also led White to index New Haven land records as a hobby throughout most of his professional life. In doing so, White distinguished himself as a prominent real estate lawyer throughout the city. After the death of both White and his wife, Thomas Bennet, president of the Winchester Repeating Arms Company, purchased the house in 1889. The next change in ownership was to Elford Pary Trowbridge in 1902. Trowbridge graduated from Yale in the class of 1887 and worked as a paymaster for New England railroads. It was in 1935 that Yale purchased the building from Trowbridge and began to convert the space into the commercial site it is today. Prior to housing a Willoughby’s Coffee and Tea and the Walker Loden Gift Shop, Yale leased 258 Church Street to Hunt’s Inc., Haydon Dukeshire, a dress shop, an advertising agency, and a beauty parlor.</p>','<p>1850 - Madam Abby Salisbury - residential</p><p>1866 – Henry White – residential/law practice</p><p>1889 – Thomas Bennett - residential</p><p>1902 – Elford Brady Trowbridge - residential</p><p>1935 – Yale University - commercial</p>','<p>The first recorded resident of the lot that is presently 258 Church Street is John Cooper, who came to New Haven in 1638.

Its namesake, the Chamberlain Company, moved in immediately following the building’s construction around 1880 and remained for more than eighty years, a fixture of a bustling commercial neighborhood. The building’s simple rectilinear form and spare ornamentation speak to this functional past. The middle of the twentieth century brought economic hardship to the Ninth Square neighborhood, which was reflected by more rapid turnover of the Chamberlain’s tenants and which ultimately gave rise to the redevelopment projects that spawned the creation of the Residences at Ninth Square. Now, the building serves as a durable example of late-nineteenth-century commercial architecture while reinventing itself as a forward-looking hub for the activation of a progressive New Haven arts community.</p>','<p>	Planted on the corner of Orange and Crown, the Chamberlain building is physically imposing but not necessarily immediately dazzling. Its four and a half stories rise solidly and somewhat plainly from the street in a uniform block; its brick surfaces are painted pale beige. Ornamentation is minimal, its surfaces spare and utilitarian. Function, not fashion, seems to drive its commercial architecture. Sash windows, bordered by cut stone lintels and sills, are arrayed in an evenly spaced grid that provides almost the sole source of texture on the building’s flat façade. Where a cornice once capped the building, the façade now ends somewhat anti-climactically with basic coping (1). Between the second and third floors and beneath a row of small rectangular windows are two molded-brick beltcourses with quatrefoil details, offering almost the only sign of ornamentation above the street level. Simple pilasters climb the height of the building, framing its edges and dividing its horizontal mass into sections; they subtly speak to classical revival influences, along with the double hung windows and the (now lost) dentiled cornice. From street level, though, these features are difficult to fully absorb, rising vertically with the mass of the building. A pedestrian’s perspective instead yields a view of the building’s storefront, constructed in 1935 (1), which projects from the flat surface of the building onto the sidewalk. Cast-stone piers capped with Neo-Gothic gablets punctuate the broad retail windows, and leaded-glass transom laced between piers provides a rhythmic border. Orange, blue, and green accents, once vibrant, show signs of fading and deterioration, coupled with peeling finishes and eroding stone. Above each entry, a segmental-arch fascia displays the word “CHAMBERLAIN” in relief, the chipping paint and the label itself speaking to the building’s long history. However, more recent alterations made by Artspace New Haven contrast strikingly with the structure’s humble commercial architecture and historic character, juxtaposing preservation with bold modernity. Two-story supergraphics in powder blue paint (“ART” on the Orange Street façade and “ARTSPACE” above Crown Street) boldly proclaim the power of this building’s presence in the community and speak to the energy of the future of the arts in New Haven. A brightly colored blue and orange storefront frieze displays Artspace’s three ongoing programs—The Lot, City-Wide Open Studios, and Untitled (Space)—in a sort of ticker-tape effect, with seemingly random breaks interrupting the words as their repeated forms wrap around the building. Below this frieze, the two entries are recessed, leading to a modern, spare interior whose clean white walls and open plan are ideally suited for the display of art. A communal office space is visible to the street through large windows, and, often, the gallery’s artworks emit light, or even noise, suffusing the old building with an otherworldly atmosphere pulsing from within.</p>','<p>	The Chamberlain building sits squarely within the Ninth Square Historic District in the center of New Haven’s downtown business region (2). It contributes to the neighborhood’s rich fabric of modular, rhythmic commercial facades, mostly three to five stories tall, that almost continuously line the narrow street with little setback. The facades form corridors of commercial activity that speak to the centuries-old pattern of mercantile development in New Haven. While brick constitutes the dominant building material, the neighborhood’s architectural mosaic is rounded out by buildings constructed with brownstone, pressed metal, and cast-stone in styles that range widely, including Italianate, Georgian Revival, Greek Revival, Romanesque Revival, Queen Anne, Beaux-Arts, Neo-Gothic, and Art Deco (3). Anchoring the corner of Orange and Crown streets, the Chamberlain building is modestly ornamented and minimally stylized compared to the richly detailed and well-preserved nineteenth and early-twentieth century buildings that surround it, but it does offer an example of how architectural motifs from its more elaborate contemporaries tended to trickle into workaday utilitarian structures.</p><p>	Today, this historic district continues to serve as a busy commercial thoroughfare, filled with automobile and pedestrian traffic. To the south rises the block-like brick tower of the Stonehill House, and just a block further the Knights of Columbus tower. Orange Street serves as an important New Haven thoroughfare, and just around the corner from the Chamberlain Building on busy Chapel Street, crowds frequently assemble at a nearby bus stop. Evidence of recent attempts to “revitalize” the neighborhood are visible—a “creative placemaking” public art project graces a chain link fence on Chapel Street nearby, decorative sidewalk stones are inscribed with information on the history of the area, and young tree plantings accent the streetscape. Immediately surrounding the Chamberlain building are upscale retail businesses—the Ninth Square Market, Barcade, Skappo Merkato, Euphoria Salon—that cater to economically advantaged customers. Across the street, the “Fresh Yoga” studio has recently gone out of business, yet another new vacancy in a pattern that has left local merchants concerned (4).</p>','<p>	The first business to fill the Chamberlain building following its construction around 1881 was its namesake, furniture and bedding dealer Abel C. Chamberlain and Company (5). Prior to the business’s founding as the first furniture retailer in the Ninth Square in 1832, the Chamberlain family carried a tradition of furniture-making traceable to 1636, when Edmund Chamberlain, a cabinetmaker, emigrated from England (4). In 1882, the Chamberlains moved their operation from 388-392 State Street to what is now known as the Chamberlain building, situated in what was a rich commercial neighborhood at the time (1). In the years following their establishment on the corner of Orange Crown, the Chamberlains were surrounded by a variety of mercantile and manufacturing businesses, such as builders, contractors, architects, publishers, realtors, and sellers of specialized goods (6-9). Following Abel’s death, his son George, and later their sons Robert and Robert Jr., continued the business in what is now known as the first retail furniture family business in the United States (4). From the Chamberlain building, they operated the administrative, manufacturing, and retail branches of the business. In 1926, architect Jacob Weinstein was commissioned to design an annex, which more than doubled the size of the store, and less than ten years later, the storefronts were added and the cornice removed (1). However, by the middle of the twentieth century, business suffered as the nation’s retail sector shifted its focus from individual proprietors of single goods to larger venues offering a more complete range of goods and national chains began to established low-priced department stores in New Haven (3). By 1962, Chamberlain’s relocated from the Chamberlain building, its home for eighty years, to Boston Post Road in Orange, Connecticut (1).</p><p>	In the 1960s, Yale Furniture Co. (incorporated in 1949 by Saul Z. Lappen but no longer in existence) replaced Chamberlain and Co. at 50 Orange Street (10). At the time, buildings in the immediate surroundings suffered economic and physical decline as residents and commerce flowed to the suburbs, and many went vacant or were demolished for proposed urban renewal programs (2). After only a few years of occupancy by the Yale Furniture Co., the Chamberlain building, too, went vacant (5). However, its history as a retail center for furniture continued in the 1980s when ACME Office Furniture Incorporated (originally the American Moving Company, then ACME Moving &amp; Storage Co.) moved in. From its space in the Chamberlain building, ACME supplied furniture to corporate workspaces, with clients including Southern New England Telephone, the New Haven Register, Yale, and City Hall (11). </p><p>	Through the 1980s, the Ninth Square continued to struggle (3). Little remained of its previously vibrant commercial community (12), and it began to acquire a reputation as “derelict” (13) and “blighted” (14). Its late nineteenth-century commercial architecture deteriorated without appropriate maintenance—many of these buildings’ upper floors had been vacant for almost 50 years (12). At the same time, interest in the district accumulated among non-residents who were drawn to what they saw as the city’s last cluster of nineteenth-century commercial architecture to remain standing (2). In fact, the name “Ninth Square” arose in this period to bring attention to the neighborhood’s status as the last of the city’s original nine squares to receive redevelopment attention (12). The Ninth Square District Project arose with the objective of rejuvenating a “once prosperous section of the city” (2), and the district’s property owners and merchants aligned with development entrepreneurs to form the Ninth Square Association, funding research into the buildings’ original appearance and using it to support a successful bid for a place on the National Register of Historic Places (3). With the New Haven Preservation Trust and the Downtown Council of New Haven, they formed the Ninth Square Limited Partnership and made plans to “restore” the neighborhood by attracting investors and planning apartments with ground floor retail space (12). As this redevelopment project gathered steam, ACME lost the Chamberlain building lease, providing a blow to business (15); twenty-four other local businesses, including some founders of the Ninth Square Association, were displaced in the redevelopment process (12).</p><p>	When the project temporarily stalled due to economic conditions and the unwillingness of lenders to provide a financing package, the Saint Louis housing developer McCormack, Baron &amp; Associates, Inc. stepped in to re-envision the project in partnership with New York’s The Related Companies. Together, they built a mixed-income mixed-use development branded as “The Residences at Ninth Square,” which opened in 1995. The project, which cost just under $87 million, was funded with McCormack Baron’s “creative financing” methodology, which included investments by the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority, the city of New Haven, the Department of Housing, an Urban Development Action Grant, and equity generated through the sale of federal low-income housing tax credits and historic investment tax credits, as well as significant investments from Yale University, whose administration was eager to create a more prosperous “buffer zone” between campus and what was perceived as a crime-riddled downtown (12).</p><p>	Collectively, the Residences at Ninth Square contain 335 studio, one-bedroom, and two-bedroom apartments on their upper floors and 50,000 square feet of retail on ground level, split between several buildings; the Chamberlain building houses the only two-bedroom, two-bath units in the development (12). Of the 335 apartments, 142 are reserved for tenants paying market-rate rents, while the remaining 193 (about 57% of the development) are set aside for tenants who qualify for a lower rental rate. To qualify, a tenant must make no more than 60% of the New Haven area’s median income as determined by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, but McCormack Baron also requires that the must also be employed and make at least forty percent of the median income for the area (12). While some credit the Residences with “setting downtown on a positive growth trajectory” (16), others look critically towards the project for its lack of communal space, its strict qualifications for affordable unit eligibility, and its role as an agent of gentrification, displacing local businesses with ones that do not directly benefit the inhabitants of the area (12).</p><p>	While the upper floors of the Chamberlain building still house the Residences at Ninth Square, the current tenant in the ground floor of 50 Orange Street is Artspace New Haven. Founded in 1986, Artspace is a gallery and nonprofit organization dedicated to championing artists from the New Haven area and building new audiences for contemporary art (17). Over its lifetime, the organization has served more than 6,000 artists (18). Through exhibitions, residencies, and educational and participatory programming, it seeks to activate conversations about social issues in New Haven social issues and promote investment by the New Haven community in its urban setting through “creative placemaking,” leveraging the arts to serve local interests. Since 1998, Artspace has run an annual City-Wide Open Studios festival through which 2 million square feet of underutilized or vacant space throughout the city have been activated and showcased for the benefit of artists and their supporters (19). The festival’s symbolic hub and central exhibition space is Artspace’s gallery space in the Chamberlain building.</p><p>	To renovate the building and move into the space, Artspace entered into collaborative arrangement with the City of New Haven in 2001 (20). The Connecticut Department of Economic Development, the New Haven Development Commission, and the City Planning Commission supported the project. Architect Michael Haverland oversaw the restoration of the historic structure and the creation of new facilities, including a flexible exhibition space, window installations, offices, and a workshop for an artist in residence (20). The gallery opened to the public in April 2002 and today continues to offer Artspace a permanent physical home (4).</p><p>The story of the Chamberlain building and its broader surroundings traces the ways that power stems from and is exerted over the land—a strategic commercial location close to Long Wharf imbued the site with a certain cachet in the city’s early days of industrialization; its later years were marked by the exercising of institutional power to engage in renewal projects that were, at times, devastating to local communities. Now, from the Chamberlain building, Artspace is engaged with uncovering and conversing about these local histories. Walk up to the entrance, and one finds the site’s latitude and longitude coordinates prominently displayed, with “or 50 Orange Street” written below. Beside this unusual building marker is an inscription by the artist William Stone, printed onto the glass. It says, “When I first came to Artspace I noticed that there was no street number anywhere on the building. Here, outside above the entry door, I have remedied the situation, with a different locating system that is less temporal, more international, and with less cultural connotations. Who or what is the orange? And just how far is this formerly British colonial town from the center of the empire? It is a little more than 72 degrees west of the prime meridian at the center of the former Greenwich, England.” It’s a striking statement on the site’s role today in critically and radically reimagining space and power in New Haven.</p>','<p>	The Ninth Square forms part of the historic core of New Haven, laid out in the original 1638 nine-square plan at the time of the city’s founding (3) following inhabitation by the Quinnipiac Indians prior to European colonization. Originally, like the seven other non-central squares (the central square comprised the city’s civic center and the New Haven Green), the ninth square accommodated the dwellings and associated barns, gardens, and small businesses that supported New Haven’s early agricultural economy (3).	</p><p>	Of the nine squares, however, the ninth is closest to the harbor and to Long Wharf and therefore experienced the greatest concentration of mercantile business. By the 1920s, the construction of the Farmington Canal, which offered an inland route north from Long Wharf to the Connecticut River in Northampton, Massachusetts, strengthened the commercial character of the neighborhood (3). At this point, the area began to lose its residential character as vacant land was filled with new construction and residential structures were converted for commercial use (6-9). Through the second half of the nineteenth century, the Ninth Square became central to the city’s participation in the industrialization of Connecticut. It was home to a growing number of light manufacturers (6-9). By the time of the construction of the Chamberlain building in the late nineteenth, its now characteristic rows of continuous commercial blocks were established; it was in this context of commercial and industrial development that the current structure at 50 Orange Street was erected.</p>','<h2 class="ql-align-center"><strong>Works Cited:</strong></h2><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maynard, Preston. “Historic Resources Inventory: Chamberlain Building.” Connecticut Historical Commission, 1981.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donald J.

The three buildings command an entire square block in the Trowbridge Square Historic District (entered into the National Register of Historic Places in 1985), an otherwise primarily residential neighborhood. Only the school building is still in use on this property. The convent—which was converted to the Columbus House homeless shelter in 1982—has been abandoned since 2002, and the church since 2009. Both buildings are in disrepair, with boarded and broken windows. The streetscape remains dilapidated despite multiple neighborhood renewal proposals (4, 5) in the last twenty years.</p>','52\' x 86\'','3 (plus basement)','<p>Sisters of Mercy, 1897 - ca. 1980</p><p>Columbus House Homeless Shelter, 1982 - 2002</p><p>Vacant, 2002 - present</p>','<p>The Sacred Heart Convent building is of the Jacobean Revival style, referencing an English Renaissance type that includes some Gothic elements. It has modest surface detailing and clear symmetry, fitting for the austerity of a convent and similar to late-nineteenth-century factory buildings.</p><p>It is a three-story masonry structure clad in brick with a cross-gabled asphalt roof (1). Each gable has striated brick and brownstone coping on its parapet, and there is an octagonal cupola topped with a crucifix at the gables’ crossing. The windows are evenly spaced and most have a segmented arch delineated by brickwork. On the east façade, the first floor has several pointed arches and the second and third have purely rectangular windows. On the north (front) façade, there is a grouping of rectangular bay windows over the entrance with a crenelated parapet, and all other windows are rectangular with brownstone outlines.</p><p>Around most of the circumference of the façade, there is a thin line of brownstone just under the second-floor windows and a slight recession of the façade at the base of the third-floor windows, creating a slight horizontal focus. Angled buttresses are positioned at each corner.</p><p>The building has a raised brick basement (2) resulting in seven steps up to the central entrance under a Gothic arch. There is an additional first-floor entrance on the west side with a stepped parapet. A rear stairwell appears to be a cinderblock structure and was likely added in the 1980s during a series of renovations to convert the convent to a homeless shelter.</p><p>Currently, windows and doors are boarded up.</p>','<p>The Sacred Heart campus occupies a full square block on the border of the Trowbridge Square and Hill districts. The convent is located in between the Sacred Heart Church and Rectory to its east and the Saint Martin de Porres Academy (formerly Sacred Heart School) to its west. Between the convent and school is a somewhat overgrown parking lot, with a basketball court and garage in similar states of disrepair at the south end near Portsea Street. Together, the three main buildings physically dominate an otherwise primarily residential Columbus Avenue and Trowbridge neighborhood. Local housing includes single- and multi-family modest wood-framed homes, mostly from the latter two thirds of the nineteenth century (3). Directly across Columbus Avenue is a large open parking lot in place of the former Yale School of Nursing, and Yale’s hospital and medical school campus proceed further north along Cedar Street.</p><p>Sacred Heart’s square block comprises the northeast corner of the original Trowbridge Square Historic District. Laid out by Simeon Jocelyn and Isaac Thompson in 1830, the neighborhood (originally called Spireworth and then Mount Pleasant) was to be a miniature model of New Haven’s nine-square plan, in this case with Trowbridge Square as the center public green. Jocelyn, and by the 1850s several others, developed the land primarily as working-class housing in the Greek and Colonial Revival styles. Some streets include several identical houses in a row due to speculative ventures (3).</p><p>In 1972, the larger neighborhood of “The Hill” was deemed a target for redevelopment and renewal by the City of New Haven. The Trowbridge Square Historical District has been on the National Register of Historic Places since 1985 (3).</p><p>In 2000, the Yale Urban Design Workshop put forth a redevelopment proposal for Trowbridge Square, citing increasing numbers of vacant lots, abandoned houses and boarded-up commercial spaces (4). Similarly in 2013, the City Planning Department of New Haven made suggestions specifically for the reuse of the Sacred Heart property in an effort for neighborhood revitalization (5). Neither plan seems to have been implemented. The current condition of sidewalks and landscaping in the neighborhood is poor, and the Sacred Heart property is lined with a rusted chain-link fence.</p>','<p>Simeon Jocelyn, one of the aforementioned founders of Spireworth (Trowbridge Square), was a reformer, minister and abolitionist. He infused his views into the neighborhood plan: it was seen as “a model residential community for members of the city\'s low-income population, a temperate and egalitarian village populated by blacks and whites living in peaceful harmony”(3, page 2). Some land deeds contained restrictive covenants barring racial discrimination in property sales. However, most black residents had relocated by the mid-1870s, concurrent with an influx of Irish immigrants due to nearby railroad work (3).</p><p>A strong Irish Catholic community, and by the early twentieth century through World War II, an incoming Italian Catholic community, explains the demand for a Catholic parish in the neighborhood. The church building was extant since ca. 1852 as “South Church, Congregational” (a form of Protestant) until it was purchased by the diocese in 1874 (6). The church then purchased the adjacent land for the future convent and school throughout the 1880s and into the 1890s (7), first adding a rectory directly south of the church in 1890, then constructing the Sacred Heart School on the west side of the property in 1894, and finally completing the convent in 1896 (8). The Sisters of Mercy, who taught at the Sacred Heart School, moved into the convent building in 1897 after living for several years in other buildings, likely the original houses on the property. Apart from a convent fire in 1899 that claimed the life of one Sister (9), no events of import are reported during the convent’s early decades.</p><p>The Trowbridge Square district saw a decline in its Catholic population following World War II as black and Hispanic families moved in, and there was a subsequent decline in the entire neighborhood population in the 1960s due to the bankruptcy of the railroad and the construction of highways replacing houses (10, p17). By 1972, the City of New Haven Redevelopment Agency had displaced 276 families and publicized their intention to displace 1043 more (10, p18).</p><p>Enrollment at the Sacred Heart School was cut in half between 1965-69 (10, p19), decreasing the demand for teachers. At the same time, a national decline in the number of young women becoming nuns meant that the Sacred Heart Convent was underoccupied. As the St. Martin de Porres Academy recounts in their centennial book, these factors led to the decision that the remaining Sisters would be of more use elsewhere, and they left by 1980 (10, p21).</p><p>As of 1982, the Sacred Heart Parish leased the convent building to the newly founded Columbus House, a New Haven homeless shelter, for nominal cost. A number of renovations and upgrades noted on permits (see documents) took place throughout the 1980s, including room partitions, new windows, and a front awning (11). At its founding, Columbus House provided 35 beds, expanded to 48 beds in 1984 (12, p2, 4) and finally to 52 beds by the early 2000s (12, p12). In 1994, Sacred Heart began increasing monthly rents, reaching $1000/month by 2000. In that year, they issued a legal notice to Columbus House to vacate the building by the following summer (13). It is unclear the status of the non-profit from 2001-2002, but by November 2002 Columbus House had moved to a new, custom building elsewhere in New Haven (12, p12).</p><p>The Sacred Heart Convent building has been unoccupied since 2002 and the exterior is currently in disrepair, with boarded-up windows and cracked glass. The church, too, was abandoned in 2009 when the Sacred Heart Parish merged with Saint Anthony’s and moved into their space on Washington Avenue (14). An official decree by the Archdiocese of Hartford declaring the merger was not signed until 2017 (15).</p><p>The Archdiocese of Hartford, which owns the property, put it on the market in March 2010 (16). A subsequent offer by the Communidad Cristiana de Restauración a las Naciones in March 2011 seemed promising (17), as the City of New Haven even approved of rezoning to split the church and convent into one property and St. Martin de Porres Academy, still in operation, into another (18). However, no further reporting on the matter has been found and the property remains unoccupied and in the hands of the Archdiocese.</p><p>In 2013, the City Planning Department of New Haven proposed a Hill-to-Downtown plan with the goal of transforming the surroundings into a walkable mixed-use neighborhood. Suggestions were made for the revitalization of the Sacred Heart campus. No further evidence of action on this plan can be found (5).</p>','<p>The convent and school buildings replaced twelve wood-frame houses (and their outbuildings) (19) on the 1.52 acre plot (20). These houses were likely products of the original Spireworth/Trowbridge Square development of the mid-nineteenth century. Records from the White Brothers real estate law firm show that the acquisition of these properties by the Sacred Heart Parish was gradual, taking place mostly throughout the 1880s and into the mid-1890s (7). Four private houses remained along Portsea Street even after the convent\'s construction, as shown in the 1911 atlas (21), but they were purchased by the church and torn down by 1924, as evidenced by the 1924 Sanborn map.</p>','<p><strong>WORKS CITED</strong></p><p><strong>1.</strong> 200 Columbus Avenue Tax Assessment, City of New Haven Online Assessment Database, Vision Government Solutions, October 1, 2016. http://gis.vgsi.com/newhavenct/Parcel.aspx?Pid=15331</p><p><strong>2. </strong>Historic Resources Inventory. “Sacred Heart Convent.” Prepared by Preston Maynard, New Haven Preservation Trust.

Standing four stories tall, the prominent Washington Building was designed with a beautiful grand entryway with period mosaic tile floors, hand-carved wood trim, an elegant marble staircase, ornamental railings, an exquisite modillion cornice and decorative masonry throughout; All of which have been recently restored to their original splendor by The Hurley Group. Although initially used primarily for commercial office space, the second, third, and fourth floors are now home to 18 luxury apartments. Each of which has been constructed to blend modern and contemporary details with charming historic elements.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">With its symmetrical facade, smooth masonry construction, richly carved terracotta window supports, fluted columns, flat roof, and an ornate projecting modillion cornice, The Washington Building embodies a late renaissance revival architectural design (1). Built in the year 1900, the building was initially home to many small office spaces (2nd, 3rd, and 4th floors), retail stores and restaurants. Some originals included Hof-Brau-Haus restaurant, Frolich Cigar Store, and Nathan Kaufman Men\'s Furnishings (1). Although in 1955 alterations were made and some commercial tenants changed, the overall function and layout of the building did not change. It was not until 2016 that significant renovations were made. Although the ground floor remained retail space, at this time, the upstairs office spaces were transformed into luxury apartments (4, 5).</span></p><p><br></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Washington building is a contributing building to New Haven\'s Historic Ninth Street District, an area of the city that on May 3, 1984, was placed on the National Register of Historic Places (6). The Ninth Square district is centered around the intersection of Chapel Street and Orange Street and is comprised of 78 well-preserved 19th and 20th-century commercial structures (9). The Washington Building shares many similar qualities with its surrounding ninth square neighbors. Most buildings in this district are 3-5 stories tall with little to no setback from the sidewalk and are comprised of stylish facades of masonry construction featuring decorative treatments in terracotta and ornate cornice detail or wood carvings (9). Located on the edge of the district, the rich texture quality of the Washington Building\'s front facade contrasts sharply with the sleek unornamented facades of the modern buildings around it.</span></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Edward M. Clark was the original owner of The Washington Building and remained owner until 1911 when it was sold to the Hubinger family (1, 2). In 1953, ownership transferred to Woodstock Realty Incorporated, and today, it is owned by The Hurley Group (7). Tenants have come and gone through the years but have consistently followed the trend of retail shops and restaurants on the ground floor, with professional offices above - typically occupied by lawyers, dentists, and insurance agents. By 1946, ground floor tenants consisted of Schulte Cigars, Florsheim Shoes, and Whitten\'s Haberdasher. Today nail pro is the only residing retail shop in the building. One of the building’s controversial former tenants was the Gotham Citi Café, a nightclub that created many issues for this otherwise quiet commercial district. The recent renovations of the Washington building have sparked further improvement to its residing area of the ninth square region, a culturally vibrant district of the city that has helped spur downtown development and revitalization(8).</span></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The intersection of Church and Crown has been home to numerous commercial structures long before the introduction of the Washington Building in 1900. In 1849, the intersection was home to a boot and shoe emporium as well as a Chinese tea store. In fact, The Washington Building itself replaced one of New Haven\'s earliest hotels- The Central House (7).</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>','<p>1.Connecticut Historical Commission, <em>Historic Resources Inventory Document: The Washington, </em>139</p><p>2.Atlas of New Haven 1911, <em>Sanborn Fire Insurance Map, Plate 13, </em>1911.</p><p>3.Sanborn Map Company of New York, Atlas of New Haven 1924, <em>Sanborn Fire Insurance Map, Plate 5, </em>1924.</p><p>4.The New Haven Group, <em>New Haven Office Building to be Converted to Apartments, </em>accessed February 20th, 2018.</p><p><a href="http://www.thenewhavengroup.com/MarketNewsItem.aspx?MarketNews_ID=207" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">http://www.thenewhavengroup.com/MarketNewsItem.aspx?MarketNews_ID=207</a></p><p>5 .Mary O’Leary, <em>Downtown New Haven office building to be converted to apartments, keep retail component,</em> accessed February 20th, 2018.</p><p><a href="https://www.nhregister.com/business/article/Downtown-New-Haven-office-building-to-be-11343260.php" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">https://www.nhregister.com/business/article/Downtown-New-Haven-office-building-to-be-11343260.php</a></p><p>6.The Washington, <em>Home and History, </em>accessed February 19th, 2018.</p><p><a href="https://www.thewashingtonbuilding.com" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">https://www.thewashingtonbuilding.com</a></p><p><a href="https://www.thewashingtonbuilding.com/history/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">https://www.thewashingtonbuilding.com/history/</a> .</p><p>7.New Haven Building Archive, <em>35-39 Church Street, </em>accessed February 21st, 2018.</p><p><a href="https://nhba.yale.edu/building?id=58e6b948adb817121752a688#" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">https://nhba.yale.edu/building?id=58e6b948adb817121752a688#</a>.</p><p>8.Tom Condon, <em>After two decades, it’s New Haven’s SoHo, </em>accessed February 20th, 2018.</p><p><a href="https://ctmirror.org/2016/08/16/after-two-decades-its-new-havens-soho/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">https://ctmirror.org/2016/08/16/after-two-decades-its-new-havens-soho/</a>.</p><p>9.New Haven Preservation Trust, <em>Ninth Square Historic District, </em>accessed February 21st, 2018.</p><p><a href="http://nhpt.org/index.php/site/district/ninth_square_historic_district/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">http://nhpt.org/index.php/site/district/ninth_square_historic_district/</a></p>');

Commons, the university-wide dining hall, opened in 1901, while Memorial Hall and Woolsey Hall were later dedicated in 1903. The Beaux Arts Neoclassical style of the building, an interruption to the predominantly Collegiate Gothic style of Yale buildings, meant to perhaps elevate Yale to a prestigious institution by taking advantage of the power associated with Neoclassical designs. The location of the Bicentennial Buildings in the geographic center of Yale University —&nbsp;connecting Yale College and Science Hill — which is suggestive of its role as a symbol for Yale’s expansion from a college to a university.&nbsp;</p>','<p>The Bicentennial Buildings were built in the Beaux Arts Neoclassical design, which is characterized by the use of stone, a symmetrical façade, and decorative columns. From the side of the Buildings facing Hewitt Quadrangle, Commons is most recognizable due to its portico with towering Corinthian columns. Although Commons is primarily used as a dining hall, the entablature has inscriptions of the names of World War I battles, which is how Commons relates itself to Memorial Hall. Woolsey Hall appears somewhat plainer, both on the quadrangle side and the College Street side; its windows with balconies is its most distinctive feature. Commons has a gable roof, while Woolsey Hall has a hip and flat roof, probably due to the acoustic needs of Woolsey Hall. Memorial Hall is arguably the most distinctive of the three structures of the Bicentennial Buildings, both due to its location and its design. Elizabeth Mills Brown considered the domed rotunda a “matronly version of Bramante’s Tempietto.” The Tempietto is a commemorative tomb in a cathedral in Italy, an appropriate model for a building that commemorates Yale’s dead.</p><p><br></p><p>The Bicentennial Buildings have experienced few notable alterations. Woolsey Hall was modernized in 1948, where some of the more decorative touches in the interior were added, and the exterior was restored in 1984.&nbsp;</p>','<p>The Bicentennial Buildings are found in Hewitt Quadrangle, on the southwest corner of College &amp; Grove. John Russell Pope, an architect hired to plan the university’s expansion, intended Hewitt Quadrangle to be the “link that would unify the whole Yale campus.” (Pinnell). One entrance faces the south side of campus (Old Campus and Cross Campus), while the other entrance directly faces the scientific schools. The Memorial Hall is somewhat reminiscent of Osborn Hall, opening on the corner of College and Chapel, where Bingham Hall is currently located. While Osborn Hall opened to the rest of New Haven, Memorial Hall opened to the rest of Yale.</p><p><br></p><p>The Neoclassical building situated in the center of campus is an anomaly that implies a monumentality to the structure. The whites of Hewitt Quadrangle contrasted with the red bricks of Yale’s Collegiate Gothic structures emphasized “the dawn of a new age” and the “grandeur of scale” represents both the expansion and unification of the university (Mills Brown). Furthermore, the Memorial rotunda bears a striking resemblance to Bramante’s Tempietto. However, the Tempietto is situated in the courtyard of San Pietro in Montorio, while the Memorial rotunda occupies a street corner. Brown argues that the placement of the rotunda was meant to turn “a difficult corner that is not quite a right angle” and to control “the long flanking wings” that is Commons and Woolsey. We could also argue that the rotunda, the most distinguishable of the three structures, was placed conspicuously at a street corner as Yale’s attempt to assert its presence in the city as it becomes a fully-realized university.</p>','<p>Under Theodore Dwight Woolsey (Yale president 1846-1871), the Sheffield Scientific School, Art School, and Graduate School were established but remained independent from Yale College (Kelly). Yale had the makings of a university, but it needed unification. In the 1850s, before he was president of Yale, Timothy Dwight (inaugurated 1886), pushed for Yale’s development, which he considered to be one of the primary roles of Yale’s president. In collaboration with James Dwight Dana, a New Haven scientist, the two drew attention to Yale’s need for physical expansion and fund raising. In 1890, Yale Corporation established the Alumni University Fund, in response to alumni enthusiasm for a university expansion. While the alumni donations themselves was not responsible for the funding of the expansion, large donations from a few individuals helped to raise $5 million by 1901 (Kelly).&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The actual planning for the Bicentennial Building project did not start until Arthur Twining Hadley’s tenure (1899-1921). In 1899, he appointed Anson Phelps Stoke, three years out of Yale college, as his secretary, and the two presided over the building project (Scully et al.). A competition was held for the design of the Bicentennial Building, where Carrere and Hastings’ Beaux Arts Neoclassical won over other Collegiate Gothic entries, such as R.H. Robertson’s. (See Archival Documents.) The Beaux Arts Neoclassical design of the Bicentennial Buildings was not initially received with enthusiasm. George B. Post, architectural adviser to the project, attributed the lack of enthusiasm to people’s visions of university ideals the buildings should represent — the conflict was between the “grandeur and picturesqueness,” more closely associated with the Gothic style, and the “speed and power” of Neoclassical architecture, as showcased in the 1893 Columbian Exposition. Yale, in choosing Neoclassical, chose power (Pinnell). </p><p><br></p><p>Commons (opened in 1901) was the university-wide dining hall, and until it was closed this year, it was typically used for traditional Yale College events such as the First-Year Holiday Dinner and First-Year Formal (formerly Freshman Screw). The space was also available for rental by student groups and other Yale-affiliated organizations. The space has been used for conferences, networking events, and even an undergraduate-cooking competition (Final Cut). The Schwarzman Center renovations will turn Commons into a multi-purpose space to host Yale’s special events. The dining hall will be reopened, but the basement will also be repurposed for student use. Renovations to the Schwarzman Center should not affect Woolsey and Memorial Hall (Schwarzman Center website). </p><p><br></p><p>Memorial Hall and Woolsey Hall both opened in 1903. While Memorial Hall has less of an official use, it serves as a connection between Commons and Woolsey Hall. During the day, the rotunda is especially used as a pathway, almost a corridor, between the south side of campus and Science Hill. John Russell Pope’s plans for the university was never enacted, but in the use of the rotunda as a walkway, the purpose of the Bicentennial Buildings as a link between the north and south sides of campuses is perhaps partially realized. </p><p><br></p><p>Woolsey Hall seats 2,600 people and was the first secular assembly hall of the university, possibly in response to criticisms of conservatism (Kelly). It is used for university events such as Class Day, Commencement, First-Year Assembly, Bulldog Days, and special events such as the Yale Climate Conference with John Kerry. Rental to external organizations is limited, usually only to local organizations such as the New Haven International Arts and Ideas Festival and/or large-scale musical groups such as the New Haven Symphony Orchestra (Purcell).</p><p><br></p><p>Woolsey Hall is famous for the Newberry Memorial Organ, which is considered one of the best concert organs in the country. The construction of the organ was overseen by Benjamin Jepson, the first University Organist. The organ originally built by Hutchings-Votey Company in 1902 was rebuilt by Steere &amp; Son in 1915, then enlarged and reconditioned by the Skinner Company in 1928 (Murray). Pipe organs have a historic role of being municipal instruments, bringing music to towns or cities that don’t have their own symphony orchestra (Dzeda). Benjamin Jepson’s commitment to building and perfecting the Newberry Memorial Organ could be interpreted as part of Yale’s attempt to form larger ties to the city as it expands. One could also argue that major changes to Woolsey Hall is partially curtailed by the significance of the Newberry Memorial Organ and the challenges it poses to renovation. </p><p><br></p><p>Management of Commons, Memorial Hall, and Woolsey Hall appears to be done by several different Yale departments. The significance of Schwarzman Center remains to be seen, especially as it faces opposition from both students and faculty (Yale Daily News).</p>','<p>The 1886 Sanborn Fire Insurance map shows that there were four adjacent brick buildings on the site of Woolsey Hall. The 1888 New Haven Hopkins Atlas also shows the same four brick buildings. There also seems to be two frame buildings, two for each of the properties. These brick buildings were probably row houses from the same developer, as they are presented as a unit on the map. College Street at the time was home to New Haven’s prominent citizens, which further implies that these structures were indeed row houses. However, specific information on the tenants is unknown (New Haven Museum Scrapbook Collection). </p><p><br></p><p>Construction of the University Dining Hall/Commons began in 1901 while construction of Memorial Hall and Woolsey Hall was still only scheduled, as shown on the 1901 Sanborn Fire Insurance map. Commons opened its doors in 1901, while Woolsey and Memorial Hall were dedicated June 20, 1903 (Yale Daily News).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>','<p>“About the Current Building | Stephen A.

The main block of the church was completed in 1905, and its most prominent feature is a four-sided tower rising above the street-facing façade, accented with Indiana limestone. An addition to the east was constructed in 1964, featuring flat surfaces and a rectangular geometry characteristic of the International Style. St. Luke’s Episcopal Church has occupied the building since its construction. Founded in 1844 when African American members of Trinity Church separated to form their own congregation amidst an atmosphere of racial tension, St. Luke’s has played an important role in the social history of New Haven, and the church continues to transform the community with its outreach and development efforts.</p>','39’x81’','2','<p>None. The building has been owned and occupied by St. Luke’s Episcopal Church since its construction.</p>','<p>St. Luke’s Episcopal Church consists of a late Gothic Revival style main block built of red brick with Indiana limestone accents, as well as an International Style addition of red brick and cinderblock construction (22). The main block, designed by Brown and von Beren in 1905, features a four-sided tower crowning its southern, street-facing elevation, with minimal signs of deterioration or weathering (3, 4, 22). The building’s relatively simple appearance places it in the late Gothic Revival rather than the Victorian Gothic style (22), but it nonetheless displays some degree of ornament. Crenellations define the peak of the tower, while gargoyles thrust outward below. The tower is penetrated by an arch, with an iron pattern filling its opening (22). At the street level, a pair of red doors are housed beneath a limestone arch. The gable roof of the main block is covered with slate tiles (1, 10). While the transept is not highly pronounced, it intersects the nave near its northern end, such that the design of the church resembles a Latin cross layout. A two-story addition lies to the east of the main block, intersecting the original portion such that the entire building forms an “L” that mirrors the shape of the parking lot. Built in 1964, the addition was designed in the International Style with planar walls, a flat roof, and rectangular windows on its north and south&nbsp;facades. A building permit was granted in 1988 for the construction of a wheelchair accessible ramp, which was built adjacent to the parking lot along the eastern elevation of the main block (12). The building’s entrance faces the parking lot, protruding from the addition, and its double doors are covered by a cantilever. </p><p><br></p><p>Once inside, a vestibule leads into the nave of the church, which has walls of faintly colored brick, a ceiling constructed of stained pine, the original wooden pews, and stained-glass windows designed by Robert Pinart (17, 22). A gas explosion in 1947 caused significant damage within the nave, destroying seven stained-glass windows, sending a slab of concrete into the street, and dislodging 12 of the pews, although no signs of the damage remain (15). Underneath the main block lies a crypt, which has been furnished to be used as overflow and storage space. Within the more recent addition, a large multipurpose room spans the majority of the top floor, flanked on its north and south by identical sets of five windows, while doors at the western end of the room lead to a kitchen. The lower floor of the addition contains a main hallway leading to small individual rooms and office spaces. The floors of the addition are offset from those of the original structure, such that the top floor of the addition is above the level of the nave, while the bottom floor of the addition is below. As a result, stairs must be traversed from the level of the nave to reach either the top or bottom level of the addition.&nbsp;</p>','<p>St. Luke’s is located on Whalley Avenue, a major commercial thoroughfare home to a diverse variety of retail stores, restaurants, and other consumer businesses. St. Luke’s is bordered to the west by a building housing Whalley Seafood, Papa John’s Pizza, and a branch of a local nonprofit, while the Rubber Match furniture store lies to the southeast of the church. Whalley Avenue is lined by trees on either side, with a string of power lines crisscrossing the street at various points, including directly in front of the church. St. Luke’s is currently taking an active role in shaping its environs, having formed St. Luke’s Development Corporation in an effort to support the local community (18, 19). This entity has purchased properties at 115, 125, and 129 Whalley Avenue, and it has also developed a senior housing complex at 120 Goffe Street (18). Future plans include further residential and mixed-use developments in the area. This locale is also the focus of the Whalley Avenue Revitalization Program, an effort by the City of New Haven to support development in the district (22).</p>','<p>Completed in 1905, the late Gothic Revival building was constructed to house the growing congregation of St. Luke’s Episcopal Church. St. Luke’s was formed in 1844 by African American members of Trinity Church who separated from Trinity during an era of pervasive discrimination (15). In the early part of the 19th century, African American residents of New Haven were barred from voting, attended separate schools from white residents, and were often relegated to their own sections or required to stand by the wall when attending church (21). A number of individuals attempted to form separate congregations for African Americans, including the abolitionist Simeon Jocelyn. Jocelyn’s group gained its formal status as a Congregational church in 1829, and the present-day United Church of Christ on Dixwell Avenue traces its origins to that congregation (21).&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>During the 1820s, African American members of Trinity Church began to meet independently of the church, but these meetings were largely informal until 1844, when they officially founded St. Luke’s (21). Although parishioners of St. Luke’s initially convened in a facility owned by Trinity Church, they moved to a building on Park Street in 1852, and by 1894, the church began fundraising for the construction of the current building on Whalley Avenue (21). Among the founding members of St. Luke’s was Alexander DuBois, the grandfather of the famed civil rights activist W.E.B. DuBois (15, 21). In fact, W.E.B. DuBois himself was born in New Haven and baptized at St. Luke’s. St. Luke’s was also the family church of Edward Alexander Bouchet, the first African American to graduate from Yale (16). Throughout the 20th century, St. Luke’s took on an increasingly active role in the city of New Haven, including participating in the development of affordable housing and hosting a school for teenage mothers. Today, St. Luke’s continues to be active in the community, undertaking development projects while hosting a range of service and outreach programs.&nbsp;</p>','<p>Prior to the construction of the main block of St. Luke’s Episcopal Church, a wood-frame structure stood on the site at 113 Whalley Avenue, which was home to Rachel L. Craft, Ai R. Burwell, and Ms. Eliza A. Deming (9). Another wooden structure stood on the land where the 1964 addition was built. This building, at 26-28 Sperry Street, had previously served as the rectory for St. Luke’s (16). While the location largely consisted of agricultural land as late as the 18th century, Whalley Avenue gained importance with the construction of a turnpike and bridge that allowed access to Westville (2). St. Luke’s currently stands in the Dwight-Whalley neighborhood. Development in the Dwight district was spurred by speculators in the 1830s, who constructed housing and shaped the area’s roads (5). The neighborhood benefitted from an industrial boom in the 1850s, attracting artisans and laborers, many of whom participated in the carriage industry (5, 6). By the early 20th century, the Dwight neighborhood had a growing diversity of residents, including a large African American population and immigrants from Italy and Poland. Following World War II, the neighborhood was increasingly occupied by lower income residents, and its population decreased as its buildings began to fall into disrepair (5). Revitalization efforts have since reshaped the area, which continues to be home to a large number of 19th century buildings.&nbsp;</p>','<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"107 Whalley Av."

The front gable is decorated with jagged patterns, and has a floral motif at the peak of the gable. There are slight overhangs that are shingled, with jagged patterns. The roof has two levels of horizontal window panes. Three chimney sticks out from the roof, two on the sloped sides, and one in the middle. The chimneys are all made of bricks.</p><p>The porch on the first floor protrudes out, with the middle portion covered up. The roof of the porch is flat, with square posts and doric capitals.

Charles Atwater was the son of a iron manufacturer in Birmingham, Connecticut, while Helen G. was the daughter of the Downes, a pin manufacturer. The couple had two daughters -&nbsp;Jean H. Atwater was the older daughter, and the younger was Helen C. Atwater. After the couple’s death, the deed of the house was left to the sisters in 1915.</p><p>Helen C.

Ciampolini until her death in 1967.</p><p>In 1968, the property was bought over by Thompson and Peck, Inc., an insurance company in New Haven. It is currently owned by law firm, Balzano &amp; Tropiano, P.C., and shared with Noble Wealth Advisors of Janney Montgomery Scott LLC.

The road systems were unchanged since 1890. Opposite the current site, along Edwards Street, was Helen G. Atwater’s family home. The Downs house has since been demolished, and is now Planned Parenthood - New Haven Health Center.</p><p>Apart from the rear addition in 1969, there was an addition of a circular asphalt drive in front of the house. According to the Sanborn Maps of 1961, there was an additional building built at the rear of the building, probably a shed, which no longer exists.</p>');

Klem Tenant Building was originally built for the dressmaker Mary J. Klem in 1897-1898 on land given to her by George Klem, a compositor for TM&amp;T Company. While their relationship is unknown, I infer that George was Mary’s father. Despite owning the building, Mary never resided at 59 Dixwell. She used the building as a tenant structure while she lived at 26 Elm Street</span><a href="#_ftn1" target="_blank" style="color: windowtext;">[1]</a><span style="color: windowtext;"> or 230 Orange Street</span><a href="#_ftn2" target="_blank" style="color: windowtext;">[2]</a><span style="color: windowtext;"> (according to two different sources). At some point before 1911, she sold the building to a Mr. C. McDermott, who used it as a tenant building as well. The first known residents were Mrs. Rachel C. Ferguson and Mr. Edward Harris in 1913. Because of the historical tradition against a man and a woman living together before marriage, I imagine that these two were separate tenants living on separate floors. The two-storied structure of the building allows for multiple tenants to live in the building at the same time. Many different tenants lived in the building until 1933, the last year a tenant inhabited 59 Dixwell Ave. That was Virginia native</span><a href="#_ftn3" target="_blank" style="color: windowtext;">[3]</a><span style="color: windowtext;"> Mr. James M. Raine. </span></p><p><span style="color: windowtext;">	After Raine left, the building was vacant in 1934. One year later, in 1935, the Keyes Funeral Home moved in. The Keyes Funeral Home was located at 59 Dixwell until 2010 – the last year that a New Haven Register obituary listed the Keyes Funeral Home at 59 Dixwell Ave. It seems that at multiple times throughout the 20</span><sup style="color: windowtext;">th</sup><span style="color: windowtext;"> Century, the building doubled as both a funeral home and a tenant building. Based on my research, the building housed residents—along with the Funeral Home—until the 1980’s. The 1984 Connecticut Historical Commission reported Earl Williams as the owner of the building. Thus, I infer that when Mr. Williams took ownership of the Funeral Home, he ended the practice of housing tenants in the same building as the Funeral Home. </span></p><p><span style="color: windowtext;">	&nbsp;The last obituary in the New Haven Register noting services at the Keyes Funeral Home at 59 Dixwell Ave was that of Vivienne Taylor Atkins, published on Sunday, March 28, 2010. Shortly thereafter, the Funeral Home moved to 95 Dixwell Ave, where it is referred to as either the Keyes or Keyes-Hallman Funeral Home. 59 Dixwell Ave has been left vacant ever since. </span></p><p><span style="color: windowtext;">	In 2016, Kadir Catalbasoglu, owner of the beloved Brick Oven Pizza on Howe Street, purchased the building at 59 Dixwell Ave with the intention to turn it into an apartment complex for students.</span><a href="#_ftn4" target="_blank" style="color: windowtext;">[4]</a><span style="color: windowtext;"> According to the New Haven Independent, he is pairing with SEEDnh architect Fernando Pastor on the project.

The Colonial Revival style building features a </span><em style="color: windowtext;">low gable roof</em><span style="color: windowtext;"> made of </span><em style="color: windowtext;">roll asphalt</em><span style="color: windowtext;">, a </span><em style="color: windowtext;">two bay side hall entry</em><span style="color: windowtext;">, a </span><em style="color: windowtext;">one-story brick wing</em><span style="color: windowtext;">, </span><em style="color: windowtext;">bracketed cornices</em><span style="color: windowtext;">, and a large </span><em style="color: windowtext;">canted window bay</em><span style="color: windowtext;"> that spans the entirety of the first and second floors.</span><a href="#_ftn1" target="_blank" style="color: windowtext;">[1]</a><span style="color: windowtext;"> Three white panels separate the windows on the first and second floors, decorated with simple yet elegant ornamentation, adding a white highlight to the brick building’s orange hue. Apart from the window bay there is minimal ornamentation, giving the building a serious, dignified character. A large brick chimney stands tall above the roof. One structure best communicates the building’s dignity: the </span><em style="color: windowtext;">colossal portico</em><span style="color: windowtext;">, supported by four stately white columns, that raises the building off of the sidewalk. This structure—along with the one story wing—is an alteration to the original tenant building. Both alterations were likely added for the Keyes Funeral Home – the wing to give extra room so the Home may prepare its services, and the portico to communicate the building’s significance to outsiders. This was a building to prepare the deceased for celebration and mourning, a task not to be taken lightly. Its architecture reflected the meaningful process that occurred inside. </span></p><p><span style="color: windowtext;">Please note the external deterioration of the columns, window bays, front door, and the many broken windows. Years of neglect take away from the building’s grandeur, but with a little imagination, one can conjure an image of 59 Dixwell in its most impressive state. </span></p><p><span style="color: windowtext;">  </span><a href="#_ftnref1" target="_blank">[1]</a> <em>59 Dixwell Ave, </em>Historic Resources Inventory, Building and Structures.

It is part of the Orange Street Historic District, and is one of the finest examples of the high style Queen Anne residences in both its neighborhood, and in the city of New Haven as a whole. A visitor to this house will be immediately struck by its beautiful intricacies and asymmetry. It is large and looming in an impressive way, and the eye of the viewer can get lost tracing the various curves, slopes, and lines of the house. The most obvious elements of its exterior are perhaps the brick walls, the shingled upper level, and the plentiful white trim. Though originally built for residential use, the building now functions as a commercial space, currently inhabited by a marketing agency and a psychotherapist. It may no longer be a home, but it still feels warm and inviting, and these qualities combined with its intactness really do take the viewer back in time. </span></p>','<ul><li><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">1889 - resident: William W.

The façade includes a high underpinning of rock-faced sandstone ashlar followed by red brick walls. At the top of the building, a hexagonal tower of Tudor form looms over a large gable. Five additional gables can be seen on the sides of the house, all of which project slightly from the structure itself and exhibit a variety of carved wooden details. These gables are enhanced by the massive, decorative chimneys that protrude from them. Slate siding and white wood trim add detail to the upper half of the house. A variety of window styles can be seen on the house, including semi-circular oriel windows and a canted bay over the wide, Roman arches of the front porch. The interior is notable for demonstrating the late Victorians’ affinity for the colors, grains, and surfaces of a variety of woods, and is considered a fine period piece.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As it has aged, the house has undergone a series of changes requiring building permits, starting in 1977 with the partial demolition of a rear attached room. In 1983, four new replacement windows were installed and sheetrock ceilings were added. In 1994, the structure was re-roofed by installing one layer of asphalt shingles over the existing layer. Lastly, in 2000, the house was updated with emergency and exit lights and a fire alarm system. <span class="ql-cursor">﻿</span></span></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">At present day, the William Converse house sits at the northernmost point of the Downtown region and the southernmost point of the East Rock neighborhood. It stands next to another large, elaborate residence, built for wealthy industrialist John Anderson. These houses, among others nearby, compose New Haven’s most cohesive surviving example of a large, middle-income residential neighborhood. Its location on Orange Street means that it is heavily trafficked on an average day, as this is one of the main roads that connects Downtown and East Rock. It not only receives heavy traffic by car, but also by pedestrians, such as joggers, students, and cyclists. While having once existed as a residential area, most of the houses in this area have been converted into commercial spaces, meaning that it currently functions as a</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">hub for local businesses. Cast iron fences and lush shrubbery give this street the appearance of a historic neighborhood, but the business signs and parking lot additions speak to its current use. </span></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The William Converse house, as its name suggests, was originally built by and for William Converse himself. He was Treasurer, and later President, of the Winchester Repeating Arms company. He was one of a number of prominent and wealthy individuals who built and occupied large, fashionable residences in this neighborhood at the time. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">According to the New Haven City Directories, at some point in the early twentieth century this house was taken over by a new resident, Clarence R. Hooker. Hooker’s name is also visible at 436 Orange Street on the 1911 New Haven Atlas. Then, sometime before the 1920s, the building was passed on to the Knights of Columbus. For the next fifty or so years, a series of club stewards resided in the building, and the Knights used it as a clubhouse and recreational facility. The names of stewards listed as residents are as follows, starting from the beginning of the club’s use of the house and ending in 1974: Charles J. Scully, Arthur E. Chatfield, Frederick W. Harris, and Norman Fortin.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In 1974, The Realtors of Greater New Haven purchased the house from the Knights of Columbus for use as its main office facility. The Realtors planned extensive renovations to provide a modern office space designed to serve the needs of businessmen and professionals. This transition marked a turning point from the building, and since its renovation it has functioned as an office space, housing local businesses such as investment companies, psychotherapy centers, educational services, and marketing agencies. </span></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">On the lot at 436 Orange Street used to stand a house for Mayor T. Atwater Barnes, though it was removed from the site in 1884. Then, in 1887, the lot was purchased by William Converse from Harriet Anderson, wife of John Anderson, who resided in the mansion next door. Little information exists on the history of the site prior to its residence by Barnes. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In many ways, the site still looks as if it is part of an old, historic neighborhood. It likely felt this way though its years of use by the Knights of Columbus as well. In the 1970s when this area transitioned into a local business district, it probably became more heavily trafficked and lost its neighborhood feel. </span></p>','<p><em style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Atlas of New Haven</em><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">, 1911. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Brown, Elizabeth Mills. </span><em style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">New Haven: A Guide to Architecture and Urban Design</em><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">.

Press','Centerplan Development LLC (Centerplan Companies)','Robert Landino','6','226,859 sq ft (Gross Area)','<p>College &amp; Crown[i] is a six-story, $50 million mixed-use building by Svigals + Partners that epitomizes the future of urban living in New Haven: affordably built complexes with luxury touches[ii].&nbsp;Its 160 apartment units include studios (leased at $1620/month) and penthouse lofts ($5000/month) with one or two bedrooms, framed by nine-feet ceilings and hardwood floors.&nbsp;An on-site fitness center, two rooftop courtyards, a clubhouse, a recreation room, and concierge services complete this high living experience, exquisite yet conspicuously dissonant with New Haven’s divisive and rapidly growing income inequality[iii].</p><p><br></p><p>College &amp; Crown also features 20000 square feet of retail space and 138 underground parking spaces, notably fewer than what were required in the 1980s and 1990s when cars ruled the streets of Elm City[iv].&nbsp;Venerable men’s clothier J. Press, founded in 1902 on Yale University’s campus and known for its old school New England style, was the first retailer to move into College &amp; Crown in August 2015[v].&nbsp;Robert Landino, CEO of Centerplan Companies, the developer of College &amp; Crown, has called J. Press the retail anchor of the complex[vi].&nbsp;This title rings of irony, for 206 College Street is explicitly the temporary home of J. Press, after a winter storm in February 2013 ravaged its historic French Second Empire 262 York Street storefront[vii].&nbsp;New Haven demolished the structurally unsound building in January 2014, forcing J. Press to relocate to 260 College Street, and then to its present address[viii].&nbsp;A conversation with a J. Press worker revealed the clothier very much intends to move back to its original site, as Yale University works with J. Press and City Hall to rebuild 262 York Street.[ix]</p><p><br></p>','<p>Yale students commonly walk from Phelps Gate to the intersection of Chapel Street and College Street, a bridge of sorts connecting Old Campus to downtown New Haven.&nbsp;Anyone who peers down College Street while waiting for the traffic signal would notice a garish, nearly neon green banner in the distance running up the sides of a massive apartment: NOW LEASING, it announces itself in sleek, sans serif, honey grey capital letters, complete with a phone number and URL to CollegeandCrown.com.&nbsp;While the Yale College Dean’s Office laments the draw of off-campus housing and gradual erosion of the residential college system, College &amp; Crown openly and shamelessly invites us to gaze up at its tall and modern façade and imagine a more comfortable and dynamic life within its Running Bond bricked walls[x].</p><p><br></p><p>College &amp; Crown boasts an unusual hybrid composition that is at once mechanistically practical and sensitively artistic.&nbsp;The first-floor retail level is made of steel while the top four levels have a wood frame covered by brick-look veneer. In order to minimize expenses, Svigals + Partners used stick-built construction for the apartment levels atop a concrete podium[xi].&nbsp;In general, wood frame over podium structures are popular for their affordability, construction speed, and structural performance[xii].&nbsp;Likewise, paper-thin brick veneers make for cost-effective fireproofing, a top priority for architects in dense city environments[xiii].&nbsp;Already, the exterior of College &amp; Crown is decorated, rather than constructed.</p><p><br></p><p>Vertical-running elm leaves on 6-foot-wide swaths — one on College Street and one on Crown Street — further decorate the decorated exterior of College &amp; Crown.&nbsp;Chief architect Barry Svigals had fashioned small models of this art installation by hand in his Erector Square studio.&nbsp;He then created 6-foot sections in terra cotta to make a cast of concrete-look fiberglass, light enough for easy installation onto the building[xiv].&nbsp;Three lines symbolizing the Mill, Quinnipiac and West rivers that flow into the New Haven Harbour lace through the lower panels of these leaves.&nbsp;Svigals had wanted to connect his building to the historical roots and routes of its location, which is not far from the same New Haven Harbour that was once the lifeblood of the city.&nbsp;Svigals, who strongly believes in the healing potential of biophilic architectural design, had intentionally handcrafted College &amp; Crown’s elm leaf sculptures to provide evidence of the human touch and humanizing influence[xv].&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The complex evokes the late twentieth-century Stripped Classical style via its symmetry and strongly repetitive rhythm of shallow columns between plainly set windows[xvi].&nbsp;College &amp; Crown also recalls select famous Chicago School buildings.&nbsp;Alternating colours, trees, street-level awnings, and a varied roof line break down the scale of College &amp; Crown, just as Henry Hobson Richardson once broke down the massive façade of his Marshall Field’s Wholesale Store with windows framed by Romanesque arches. Chris Bockstael, an architect with Svigals + Partners, confirmed that his firm’s goal was to create a building more like row houses than a monolith[xvii].&nbsp;Likewise, College &amp; Crown’s organic ornamentation gestures to the sculpted foliage atop the entrances of Louis Sullivan’s Carson, Pirie, Scott and Company Store.</p><p><br></p><p>J. Press is but one of several identical storefronts below College &amp; Crown’s luxury apartment units.&nbsp;Walking inside reveals an incongruous and anachronistic world: fresh coats of light blue paint hug the walls behind relics from Whiffenpoof concerts and lightweight crew victories past, yellowed and chipped with age.&nbsp;Impersonal, replicable office-style ceiling panels enclose timeless Ivy League dress shirts, scarves, and neckties.&nbsp;Window-shopping customers may feel as though the clothier resists its location.</p>','<p>With its elm leaf ornaments and clean exterior that has yet to betray the wear and tear of time, College &amp; Crown is meant to be attractive to future tenants: New Haven’s wealthy and image-conscious young professionals and scholars.&nbsp;However, the look and feel of such new buildings inevitably raise larger issues, from planning to pride of place to zoning to exclusivity. </p><p><br></p><p>College &amp; Crown sits at the juncture of what have historically been two difficult New Haven streets.&nbsp;Developer John Schiavone, who is credited with transforming downtown New Haven in the late 1990s into a bustling neighbourhood and theatre district, had envisioned College Street as a central entertainment district — a revitalization project that would spill over onto Crown Street and increase its accessibility and foot traffic.&nbsp;In 2004, the scene on Crown Street was not what Schiavone and Elm City planners had hoped.&nbsp;While College Street now boasted upscale restaurants, theatres, hotels, and cigar lounges, Crown Street had become known for providing a less highbrow form of entertainment[xviii].</p><p><br></p><p>Presently, despite extensive development in the past decade, the corner of College and Crown Streets is still widely reported to be a complex location.&nbsp;At College &amp; Crown’s ribbon-cutting ceremony, New Haven Mayor Toni Harp called this complexity “so emblematic of the city”[xix].&nbsp;For instance, memories of violence haunt and mar the urban setting.&nbsp;In September 2010, after gunshots erupted on the same intersection, the city announced Operation Nightlife, a police initiative to crack down on nightlife culture in the downtown clubs and bars[xx].&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The Crown Street of 2018 overflows with culture, as it contains many of Connecticut’s best restaurants and clubs, while College Street connects the New Haven Green to the Shubert Theatre to Yale’s historic campus.&nbsp;Another apartment development targeted toward Yale graduate students, Metro Properties, stands a mere 50 feet away from College &amp; Crown[xxi].&nbsp;Yet, a certain tension remains in the intersection.&nbsp;Physical markers of stress show up in small graffiti marks on College &amp; Crown, but never on the façade, always on the side.&nbsp;Perhaps subconsciously, these graffiti artists feel like they have been pushed to the margins of the neighbourhood. </p><p><br></p><p>Pedestrians feel tension in another way: the street between College &amp; Crown and Cooperative Arts &amp; Humanities High School, which face each other, is noticeably and uncomfortably narrow.&nbsp;Alas, corporate interests and power narratives have influenced the urban setting of College &amp; Crown.&nbsp;Robert Landino, a former state representative himself, had hired zoning attorney Anthony Avallone to represent Centerplan Companies. At a Board of Zoning Appeals meeting for College &amp; Crown, Avallone successfully pushed for zoning variances allowing smaller side and rear yards, more building coverage, higher walls, less open space, smaller parking spaces, and a greater floor-to-area ratio than otherwise allowed in New Haven, in order to accommodate the scale of development that his client desired[xxii].&nbsp;Thus, College &amp; Crown intrudes into the street.</p>','<p>Enshrined in New Haven’s latest Comprehensive Plan is the idea that downtown is for mixed use: residential living, business, and medical services[xxiii].&nbsp;Former City Plan Director Karyn Gilvarg once defended the city’s rewrite of its zoning rules to facilitate the entry of complexes such as College &amp; Crown by noting the direction in which twenty-first century “new urbanism” is heading: highly dense and geared towards street and pedestrian life.&nbsp;According to Gilvarg, we are no longer in the 1960s, during which planners designated downtown as a commerce-only space[xxiv]. </p><p><br></p><p>It is important to observe that mixed use does not imply democratic use or equal access.&nbsp;Centerplan Companies has proudly advertised the fact that College &amp; Crown has the highest rents in the market[xxv].&nbsp;When J. Press moved in, Landino publicly expressed that the clothier would bring value to his tenants[xxvi].&nbsp;Note that J. Press apparel can cost hundreds of dollars — Landino must have had a particular demographic of tenants in mind. </p><p><br></p><p>Unsurprisingly, College &amp; Crown has a social history fraught with backlash and displacement.&nbsp;In September 2015, Yale Daily News interviewed an anonymous resident of Church Street South who bemoaned the offense of the Centerplan complex: while New Haven supports projects for the sake of Yale affiliates, it throws New Haven locals to the side[xxvii].&nbsp;After all, College &amp; Crown could only exist and be so profitable today at the expense of locals’ financial loss.&nbsp;In November 2006, Landino’s development proposal forced all small business owners in its path to quickly relocate their storefronts.&nbsp;We get the sense that zoning officials at City Hall should have known better than to support Landino and consequently feed Connecticut’s widening income gap between the top 1 percent and the other 99 percent[xxviii]. </p><p><br></p>','<p>In August 2014, Robert S. Greenberg, a local amateur historian, overlaid historic maps of New Haven atop Google Earth to reveal that the corner of College and Crown Streets was mere yards away from a long-vanished creek and the spot where emissaries of Reverend John Davenport, founder of the American colony of New Haven, came ashore in 1637.&nbsp;Landino declined to allow Greenberg to examine the soil of Centerplan’s development site to corroborate his suspicions and retrieve potential artefacts[xxix].</p><p><br></p><p>The history of the College and Crown Streets intersection is one of significant transformation.&nbsp;As early as records go, development in the area began as a residential space for Yale scholars and Christian religious leaders.&nbsp;In 1815-1816, a house was built on-site for Professor Josiah W. Gibbs, Professor of Sacred Literature at the Yale Divinity School.&nbsp;Professor Thomas A. Thacher and his family moved into the house in 1867, and lived there until the house was demolished in 1915.&nbsp;Across the street in 1884, Reverend Doctor Croswell moved into his new house[xxx].&nbsp;According to atlases, the intersection remained fairly underdeveloped come 1901, with the exception of small museums on Crown Street[xxxi].</p><p><br></p><p>Several early mixed-use developments in the intersection anticipated the 2015 arrival of Centerplan’s College &amp; Crown.&nbsp;The 1890 two-storied family home of Ira Atwater began to house bistros and shoe repair shoes on its ground level by 1956.&nbsp;A New Haven newspaper article in April 1915 recounted the ownership change of the Dr. Hubbard house on the northeast corner of College and Crown Streets; — the purchaser had taken it over with a view of erecting a business block on the site in the near future.&nbsp;The 1903 Hutchinson Apartments were truly a mini College &amp; Crown in their own right: flyers advertised Hutchinson as a modern and up-to-date student apartment house in New Haven and as the center of sophomore life[xxxii].&nbsp;In 1933, the city removed Hutchinson to make room for a parking space, which a 1946 map indicates was owned by E.F. Faust[xxxiii].</p><p><br></p><p>1961 saw the arrival of 196-212 College, once again at the intersection of College and Crown Streets.&nbsp;The modern office and retail building exemplified the late twentieth-century New Haven redevelopment era.&nbsp;Diverse companies occupied and rotated through the so-called Crown Street Buildings from 1961 to 2006: AH Brown Leather, Fenmore Hats, Felmont Maternity Shop, Albram’s Clothing Inc., Samuel’s Shoes, Vierra Home Improvement, and Scarpellino\'s Restaurant, among others[xxxiv].</p><p><br></p><p>In 2006, New Haven approved Landino of Centerplan’s proposal to build Residences and Shops at College Square, a 19-story residential-high rise on a lot bound by 188-196 College Street, Crown Street, and George Street.&nbsp;Residences and Shops at College Square would feature 276 luxury condominiums ($400000 to $1000000/unit) covering 15 floors, above two floors of ground-floor retail, and two floors of parking[xxxv].&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Landlords of 196-212 College readily sold their land to Centerplan and forced small businesses out of the lot.&nbsp;However, the financial crisis of 2007-2008 threw an unexpected wrench into Landino’s plans and Centerplan waited to modify their plans for the site[xxxvi].&nbsp;In the meantime, New Haven locals found innovative ways to use the empty Crown Street Buildings before the structure was demolished and converted into surface parking.&nbsp;For example, in October 2010, ArtSpace, a contemporary art gallery and non-profit organization, transformed the emptied SERA Nail Salon at 206 College Street into the Social Experiments Relational Acts salon[xxxvii].&nbsp;Landino had permitted City Hall and ArtSpace access to the building pending his revised long-term plans[xxxviii].</p><p><br></p><p>Centerplan Companies eventually decided that a low-rise rental building would be a better fit for graduate students and professionals walking to school or work[xxxix].&nbsp;Landino hired Svigals + Partners to design College &amp; Crown, asking architects to focus on creating a medium-size success, rather than a large-scale risk[xl].&nbsp;College &amp; Crown’s first anticipated completion date was Fall 2014, but ultimately opened its doors on October 29, 2015[xli].&nbsp;College &amp; Crown remains a dynamic site.&nbsp;Not only do retailers continue to cycle in and out of its retail spaces, from the Fall 2017 opening of Bonchon Chicken to the imminent evacuation of J. Press, but a conversation with a worker in the apartment lobby also revealed that average tenant turnover is a mere thirty days.[xlii]&nbsp;</p>','<p>[i] “200 College St”, New Haven CT Vision Government Solutions, http://gis.vgsi.com/newhavenct/Parcel.aspx?pid=15048.</p><p><br></p><p>[ii] Thomas MacMillan, “$50M Building OK’d for College &amp; George”, New Haven Independent, Jun 12, 2013, http://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/50m_building_okd_for_college_george/.</p><p><br></p><p>[iii] “Dwell College &amp; Crown”, Dwell Student Living, http://www.dwellstudentnewhaven.com/.</p><p><br></p><p>[iv] Joe Amarante, “Barry Svigals leaves his (artistic) mark on city architecture”, New Haven Register, Aug 2, 2015, https://www.nhregister.com/entertainment/article/Barry-Svigals-leaves-his-artistic-mark-on-city-11350879.php.</p><p><br></p><p>[v] Anne Craig, “Grand Opening of College &amp; Crown in New Haven”, News 8, Oct 29, 2015, http://wtnh.com/2015/10/29/grand-opening-of-college-crown-in-new-haven/.</p><p><br></p><p>[vi] Luther Turmelle, “Developer says New Haven mixed-use project benefitted from delay”, New Haven Register, Oct 30, 2015, https://www.nhregister.com/business/article/Developer-says-New-Haven-mixed-use-project-11341178.php.</p><p><br></p><p>[vii] &nbsp;Pooja Salhotra, “J.

The whole of this immediate area is medical buildings—Yale-New Haven Hospital, Connecticut Mental Health Center, Smilow Cancer Hospital, etc. 55 Park is striking, with a mostly glass exterior of multicolored panels, in the Internationalist style. It looks almost like a patchwork quilt. Occupied mostly by office buildings on its upper levels, it includes a Walgreen on the bottom floor. The block used to be taken up by a series of residential row houses, owned by various New Haven residents.</p>','6','<p>This building has had only one tenant, Yale-New Haven Health Systeml. But 55 Park Street now takes up what was once 55 Park St, 61 Park Street, 67 Park Street, and 73 Park Street. In 1911, these addresses were all homes owned by John McPartland, Levi Lyons, Margaret O’Brien, and Francis Atwater, respectively. They were built sometime before 1886. 55 Park Street was passed down through the McPartland family, including members Charles and AJ, and seems to have been occasionally rented to students.</p>','<p><br></p>','<p>The current structure at 55 Park Street, built in 2009, has only had one tenant, which is the Yale-New Haven hospital and a Walgreens that is downstairs. 55 Park Street serves to support Yale-New Haven hospital and specifically the Smilow Cancer Hospital, which was also built in 2009.<a href="#_ftn1" target="_blank" style="color: black;"><strong>[1]</strong></a> The Smilow Cancer Hospital is affiliated with Yale Cancer Center, which is the only Comprehensive Cancer Center in southern New England and is one of 41 in the US. Comprehensive Cancer Centers comprise about the top 4% of cancer centers in the US. Yale-New Haven Hospital has been a part of the New Haven community since 1826. The hospital formally became a part of Yale in 1913, formally educating Yale medical students.</p>','<p>55 Park Street, before 2009, was home to a residential building that was, for most of its history, owned by the McPartland family. It was passed down through that family for most of its time, and occasionally was rented to Yale students. There were other homes on the plot as well, which were also knocked down to make room for this large laboratory building. In fact, 55 Park Street now takes up what was once 55 Park St, 61 Park Street, 67 Park Street, and 73 Park Street. In 1911, these addresses were all homes owned by John McPartland, Levi Lyons, Margaret O’Brien, and Francis Atwater, respectively.</p>','<p>Beecher and Bennet. <em>New Haven Directory 1961</em>.

Though all panels are the same width, they vary in height. Some panels are opaque, in varying tones of green, gray, and blue, while others are clear but tinted. The glass panels are separated by black metal lines. The only exception is the bottom floor, which has floor to ceiling clear windows almost all around, though their width is the same as the panels. The whole of the building’s exterior is smooth, with nothing protruding. Its varying colors and panels make the building look almost like a game of Tetris. Built in 2009, 55 Park St is new and in good shape. It has a fireproof steel base. The building’s style seems to be closest to internationalist.</p><p>The inside feels distinctly modern, with open spaces, mostly white but with light-toned wood liberally mixed in.</p>');

The building may initially appear conventional, or perhaps drab—but further inspection reveals that it is a rambling, complex, inter-connected collection of structures that envelop the corner of Ellsworth and Derby Avenue. The space has catered to the manufacturing and care of textiles since its conception in 1898: It served as the home for the esteemed Monarch Laundry Company for nearly 100 years, and now houses a linen company. Nowadays, the building is an industrial landmark of the West River area.</p>','40,598 sq. feet ','2-3','<p>1898: Charles M Dobbs, of Monarch Laundry, builds 149 Derby Avenue. The business has three owners over the course of its 100-year history: Charles M Dobbs, followed by his wife, Marjorie A Dobbs, followed by their business partner, Salvatore J Alea.</p><p>1997: New England Linen purchases 149 Derby Avenue.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p>','<p>	New England Linen is made up of a series of different, connected structures. Most of the structures have the same style—white clapboard siding, cyan detailing, and white metal picket awnings covering many of the street-level windows. A base of red brick raises the building about one foot off the ground. There are four raised entrances to the structures that fit this style.</p><p>	The largest individual structure of this complex, however, has a slightly different style. This building doesn’t appear on the Sanborn Maps until 1924, and was initially built as a garage. It maintains the cyan details but lacks the clapboard sides of the earlier, neighboring structures. Instead, it is made out of a combination of brick and concrete. On either side of the front door are large windows, capped by a grand but faded “New England Linen” sign.</p>','<p>	The New England Linen building is located on the corner of Derby Avenue and Ellsworth Avenue. It’s less than a block from West River memorial park, which comprises the Yale Bowl and many of the Yale Athletic Fields. West River is primarily a low-income neighborhood. The streetscape of Derby Avenue is somewhere between urban and residential: There are no stores in the direct vicinity of the building, but one can find Dunkin Donuts or a Chinese Take-Out restaurant within a two-block radius. Across the street from the building is a bus stop, and behind that is Barnard School—an environmental studies magnet school for children in Kindergarten through eighth grade. Moving further down Ellsworth Avenue, the street becomes more residential, made up mostly of multi-family homes with lawns, fences, etc. Given the somewhat spread out, non-commercial nature of the area, this stretch of Derby Avenue does not have much foot traffic aside from nearby residents. The industrial, private nature of New England Linen’s company certainly contributes to this fact, seeing as a typical resident of the area would have little reason to walk around the company’s premises.</p>','<p>	Charles M Dobbs built the building in 1989. Dobbs served as president of Monarch Laundry for 63 years, until his death in 1961. His wife, Marjorie A Dobbs, has been vice president up until this time; following her husband’s death, she became president. When Mrs. Dobbs retired in 1978, Salvatore (Sam) J Alea was named president. Alea began working for Monarch Laundry in 1929 at age 15 as a bundler, but “worked his way up to stock clerk, purchasing agent, assistant superintendent, superintendent, a member of the board of directors, and, finally, [at age 65,] president.”<a href="#_edn1" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[i]</a></p><p>	Over the course of its history, Monarch Laundry served a wide array of customers. It did laundry and dry-cleaning for many Yale students, for the ship-crews in the New Haven port, and for Ringling Bros.-Barnum and Bailey circus when it came to New Haven.<a href="#_edn2" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[ii]</a> The majority of its work, however, came in the form of home-delivery to residents across the Greater New Haven area. </p><p>	Monarch Laundry was, for many years, a prominent New Haven business. Dobbs was a well-known figure—in 1920, his portrait was featured on the front of the National Laundry Journal.<a href="#_edn3" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[iii]</a> In its heyday, Monarch Laundry had 6,000 customers per year, a fleet of 35 Model Ford trucks, and 150 employees working at 149 Derby Avenue. By 1978, these numbers had decreased substantially: the company had 3,000 customers per year, a fleet of seven Model Ford trucks, and a work force of 50.<a href="#_edn4" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[iv]</a></p><p>	While 149 Derby Avenue was Monarch Laundry’s first and principal location, in 1944 Dobbs bought another property for fur storage, located on Park Street between Chapel and Crown.<a href="#_edn5" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[v]</a> Monarch Laundry also had a public storefront at 82 Wall Street. Advertisements for Monarch Laundry can be found in city directories and newspapers spanning many years.<a href="#_edn6" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[vi]</a> One photograph from the early 20<sup>th</sup> century depicts a Monarch Laundry billboard on the corner of Whitney Avenue and Audubon Street. It reads: "Say Old Bird / Go Home and Tell Your Mother / An Average / Weekly Family / Washing &amp; Ironing / Costs about $2.50 / Monarch Laundry.” <a href="#_edn7" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[vii]</a> </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the late 1990s, Monarch Laundry went out of business. 149 Derby Avenue, however, was maintained for a similar use: New England Linen—a textile company that specializes in uniforms for chef, kitchen, and food service workers. <a href="#_edn8" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[viii]</a> The company also has locations in New York and Boston.</p>','<p>	At the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, this area of New Haven had not yet been fully developed: the Sanborn Maps from 1901 depict only one other building on the block that houses Monarch Laundry.<a href="#_edn1" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[i]</a> As the city expanded, Monarch Laundry did, too. The Sanborn Maps from 1924 reveal the addition of another building.

This business actually teamed up with Yale to create Elm City Partners which provides a substantial portion of off-campus housing to Yale graduate and undergraduate students via apartments. As the building was constructed in 1890, it obviously has a history long prior to 2006. Before Elm City Apartments purchased the property, in 1999. Under these various larger property-owning businesses, various tenants would have come and gone every few months to few years. Considering its proximity to the University, it’s probable that some of the tenants were connected to Yale in some way. The oldest data found about 19 Lynwood’s ownership dates back to 1999, when owner Marvin L Agins sold the property to Neighborhoods. Agins, a Hamden, Connecticut native, appears to have been born in 1917 and lived in the Connecticut area for most of his life. Its unclear whom he purchased the house from or if he inherited it, but he was the last individual homeowner on record and could have lived in the house as early as thirty years after its initial construction. </span></p>','<p>Among a sea of other similarly styled houses and apartments, 19 Lynwood Place immediately attracts passersby with its bright, if not slightly faded, red front door and columns. The columns are thin and and plain, with small Greek-influenced detailing only around the very tops. The mid-sized porch has a flat, Italianate-style roof with more intricate carvings on the underside. But overall, the house is actually relatively unadorned although the door frame is etched with a simple design as well. Brick and wood paneling are combined to create the building’s facade and both are clearly weathered and aged. The brick, second floor has arched windows with the heaviest details of the building being the carvings surrounding these windows. True to its Queen-Anne style, the roof is gabled on the side of the house and unlike the porch’s top, the top of the house boasts a pitched roof. Directly adjacent the main door is a rounder, thick tourret with wood paneling painted a baby blue and larger, square windows. A side view of the house also discloses large bay windows from the inside and much more plain brick. For its time, 19 Lynwood place is really a very simply designed home that didn’t full buy into all of the intricacies of the styles it does emulate, like Queen-Anne and Renaissance Revival. </p><p><br></p>','<p>While decoratively simple, 19 Lynwood is far from austere or plain. As previously mentioned, the red and blue coloring of the house’s non-brick components are what immediately draws in a viewer. The porch is done in an italianate-style, with Greek Revivalist columns that have carved out designs topping them off. The Italianate-villa modeled roof is flat but has the most detail around the edges, that matches the cornices framing the front door. </p><p>	Looking up to the second story, exposed brick is the overwhelming aspect. The arched windows are representative of the both the Queen-Anne and Italianate styles, both of which often used curved glass for bay and rounded windows. It’s interesting how despite having extremely different aesthetic goals, the Queen-Anne and the Italianate styles also have a lot of physical overlap. For instance, both rely heavily on brick and wood paneling in their material use, which can be seen in the construction of this building. Looking directly right is a thick, rounded segment of the house. The wood paneling is much more prominent on this portion of the house and it also has its own separate, steepled roof in addition to the gabled roof over the entire house. The windows on the right side are all square but between the second and third floors is the most intricate of detailing on the house. Ribbed ribbons are carved into the house’s facade below etched cornices on the top edge of the second story. Finally, the roof is shingled and the side of the house shows the most prominent gable: with an oval window at the top surrounded by small, ornately carved designs. </p><p><br></p>','<p>Just feet away from popular restaurants and hang out spots like Terry Lodge and Box 63, 19 Lynwood is nonetheless nestled into a compact neighborhood mostly comprised of other residential buildings. The vast majority of the buildings surrounding this one are similar in size while demonstrating a variety of mix and match styles from colonial revival to tudor-style. 19 Lynwood is just one half of what is seemingly a duplex. This setup is a common, as we see many larger houses actually comprised of two, smaller row houses. Even tucked into a fairly residential neighborhood, 19 Lynwood boasts the advantage of being just a block away from Chapel Street and the more urban environment including grocery stores, coffee shops, restaurants and a variety of other businesses. </p><p><br></p>','<p>The residence on Lynwood has change hands multiple times in the last decade or so. Most recently, the last three landlords have been property rental companies acting as landlords to various renters. In the 15 years 19 Lynwood has been a part of greater real estate businesses, it could have had any number of tenants ranging from college students of Yale to the general New Haven public. While it seems less authentic for the residence to be owned by rental companies, it makes sense considering the address and its relative location to Yale, which would make it a desired place to live for anyone connected to the school. But perhaps the most interesting owner of 19 Lynwood was Marvin Agins. He is the only person listed as a sole owner of the property on its New Haven Government Solutions webpage. While Agins exact relationship to the house is unclear, he appears to be a longtime Connecticut resident who could have owned the home for up to 40 or 50 years. Additionally, since this apartment has an impressive six bedrooms and five bathrooms, there’s a strong chance it has housed a group of Yale athletes, artists or another mass of friends at some point during its 127 year life span. </p><p><br></p>','<p>According to the 1901 Sanborn fire maps, the buildings in the Lynwood and Chapel area the buildings have been fire proofed, which is especially necessary considering the heavy use of wood paneling. It’s unknown what this land was before it became a residence. It could have likely been undeveloped land around the still growing campus of Yale. </p><p><br></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">"Greater New Haven CT Apartments!"

There is a three bay side hall entry facade. The exterior uses minimal ornamentation that includes wide eaves, corner brackets, segmental window headers, 2/2 window sash, and the grouped gable windows with semi circular headers. The windows used to be framed by wooden shingles but are now bare. The property is surrounded by a brick wall with a metal gate.</p>','<p>29 Whalley Avenue is located on the outskirts of Yale’s campus. This area is a mix of 19th and 20th century residential and commercial structures. Today, it is between a Popeye’s drive through and restaurant and a gas station. This is a unique location in that many different urban contexts are adjacent. If you are looking at the front of the house, extending to the left is a low end commercial district, to the right the higher end commercial district of yale begins. Behind the house on lake place there is off campus housing where many other fraternities are located as well as Payne Whitney gymnasium on tower parkway. In front of the house there is a bar, a pizza restaurant, and the Marriot Hotel, but behind that a mix of off campus and local housing proliferates. This building, under its current usage, is viewed more as an extension of lake place, rather than interacting with any of its other contexts.</p>','<p>Before the house was erected, the lot was owned by Henry N. Oviatt. It was purchased and new house was constructed in 1885 for Edward and Ida Todd, who listed it as a residential property. However, city records show that there may have been a portion of the house open for commercial business. The 1886 Sandborn maps were not totally up to date&nbsp;with the construction of the current 29 Whalley avenue building and show a different residential structure, completely made of wood, on this lot. The1886 map also shows that the Dixwell avenue school was located within the residential community. This school is not included in the 1901 map, showing a trend towards a more residential neighborhood. In 1924 we see the emergence of the LL Gilbert Banking Corpn and the division of buildings into more commercial uses. For around 2 decades this building has been occupied by the Yale fraternity Zeta Psi. After speaking to a member of the fraternity, I discovered that there was a large culture shift in the fraternity around 10 years ago. This shift involved developing a more inclusive culture and less of one might call the "typical" fraternity scene. </p><p><br></p>','41.313414','<p>This home is a classic and simple Queen Anne.

The crisp white detailing on the facade is both ornate and playful, making the building feel as if it were plucked out of a fairy tale and placed down onto this idyllic, tree-lined section of Chapel street just north of the hubbub of the Yale campus. Built in 1916, it has been used for residence since its inception and now is home to Yale graduate students.</span></p>','<p>Haddon Hall is an imposing yet friendly 4-story red-brick Italianate-style building most notable for its repeated decorative details rendered in concrete which are painted white on the first floor. </p><p><br></p><p>The building has many strong lateral components. The indents that run horizontally through the concrete adornment of the external walls below the first-floor windows are simply an inversion of the outdents formed by the concrete panels that serve as the tops of the front stairs, alike in both thickness and spacing despite being opposite in orientation; together they form a continuous horizontal projection across the bottom half of the first floor. This lateral movement is mirrored also in the belt courses that surround the extended front doorway and those that run underneath the second and fourth-floor windows, as well as the cornice placed halfway between the tops of the fourth floor windows and the roofline. </p><p><br></p><p>The decorative brackets that support this cornice, on the other hand, assist in asserting the <em>vertical </em>separation of the front facade. The four pairs of larger, more elaborately carved brackets separate the front into three sections of equal width (indicated by five smaller, equally-spaced brackets in-between each pair), each with its own column of windows. </p><p><br></p><p>The central column of narrower windows on the second, third, and fourth floors is adorned by detailed concrete work. The form of the staggered side treatment mirrors that of the front doors, the first-floor windows to its left and right, the quoins of the front corners, as well as (in miniature form) the small crenellation that adorns the flat roof. Furthermore, the detail carved into the concrete above the third-floor windows is almost an exact copy of the front of the concrete form that sits on the ledge above the front doorway (which itself seems to evoke a miniaturized Roman palace). The small cornice that forms the theoretical ground plane of this “palace” form and the brackets supporting it further mirror the shapes of the larger cornice and brackets above.</p><p><br></p><p>The brick pattern is predominantly Fleming Stretcher Bond, with the Flemish Bond rows occuring every 6 rows. The only exceptions are the single line of Header Bonded bricks that wrap around the top and sides of the second, third, and fourth floor left and right window groupings, and the double row of vertically-oriented, Header Bonded bricks underneath the belt course of the fourth floor. </p><p><br></p><p>Overall, Haddon Hall’s bold facade in combination with its height (all other structures on the block are just two stories high in comparison to its four) make this building stand out as a predominant visual part of the streetscape. </p><p><br></p>','<ul><li>Haddon Hall is nestled between a salon and another apartment building on a quiet section of Chapel Street just south of Howe Street. The abundance of small planters filled with flowers that dot the sidewalks, carefully groomed front yards filled with shrubs and plants in front of each residence, and expansive trees on both sides of the street give the block a beautiful, friendly-neighborhood feel. Located just north of the busy Yale Arts area (with its “two world-class museums, two University theaters, three Yale Professional Schools, two hotels, [and] numerous restaurants, shops, offices, and apartment buildings” all within a 2-block radius) and around the corner from a variety of popular restaurants on Howe St, the smaller restaurants and businesses across the street receive some foot traffic during the day, but overall this section of Chapel Street feels tranquil while still being in close proximity to a wide range of resources. </li></ul>','<p>There is not much to be said for the social history of Haddon Hall. The footprint of the building as well as its use for residency have remained the same since its inception. </p><p><br></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Haddon Hall was erected in 1916 on the empty southern half of a site that had previously only been occupied by 1220 Chapel St since at least 1886 (the building exists on the earliest Sanborn map available). </span></p>','<p>1.

The archways are the small influence of Renaissance Revivalist style, while the rest of the building resembles Postmodern and Brutalist form.

You can also find small dashes the Renaissance Revivalist theme continue inside as well as Corinthian columns near the dance floor.</p>','<p>142-144 Temple Street was actually one of the last current buildings to be built on this part of Temple Street. The building really finalized the block as a true urban area, with almost no open space or vacant spots on the block. Being right across from the popular Omni Hotel and surrounded by chain restaurants allows 144 Temple Street to be the thriving restaurant and club it has become. Even before the building was erected as the Hartford National Bank, the space was used for the Olympia and Paramount Theatre, another popular social center.</p>','<p>This building was built for the Hartford National Bank and Depository in 1973. From 1913- 1970, the space was occupied by Olympia and Paramount theatres. This theatre was a staple of Temple Street prior to its demolition in 1970. Before, the site was the estate of A. Heaton Robertson, a New Haven judge and Connecticut State Senator. Most recently and most successfully (the Hartford Bank moved and has since closed), the building has been a successful restaurant and club. The success is attributed to its location in the Chapel Street District and location only one block from Yale College’s campus.</p>','<p>The site at 144 Temple Street today has been a significant plot of land since A. Heaton Robertson decided to build his estate there. After his death in 1920, his estate was demolished and paved the way for the Olympia Theatre, which later became the Paramount Theatre under new management. After thriving on Temple Street (under a different address), the building was demolished, and the current building was erected in 1973.</p>','<p>Bonan, Dave. “Paramount Theatre.” Cinema Treasures. 26 February 2018.</p><p>http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/13753#.</p><p><br></p><p>Spalding, J.

The Richardsonian Romanesque style was a revival of Roman Architecture made popular in the mid and late 1800s by Henry Richardson (4). This monumental building is a masonry structure, specifically red sandstone, with thick walls and a large box shape. The roof is extremely low pitched with a brick chimney. There are two sets of three windows on each side of the front of the building. The second-floor windows are tall, narrow and are recessed deeply into the masonry. There are also arched windows with a decorated hood above the entrance. On each side of the arched window, there are five small columns (colonnades) that have been incorporated into the wall surface, each column has an ornately decorated capital. Below these colonnades is an elaborately decorated hood above the entrance. In this decorated hood, there are seven symbols; the middle symbol is a Yale “Y”, on each side of the Y is a Star of David symbol, then next to the Star of David symbols, there are two types of Celtic knots. The entrance is elevated by a small set of stairs and the double doorway has two panes of glass. On each side of the door, there are 3 colonnades with similarly decorated capitals and bases. This building’s overall massive quality is contrasted by the intricate and embellished ornamentation. &nbsp;</span></p>','<p><span style="color: black;">The building sits near the end of the historic Hillhouse Avenue. All the buildings surrounding it are owned by Yale and the majority are used for educational purposes, except St. Mary’s Church, which is two buildings down the street. Hillhouse Avenue, with its grass covered sidewalk and massive trees, is a parklike escape from the urban setting of New Haven.&nbsp;</span></p>','<p><span style="color: black;">The architect of 15 Hillhouse, Josiah Cleveland Cady, was a prominent New York based architect of the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century (1). He shaped some of the country’s most prestigious colleges, including Yale, Wesleyan and Williams College. He predominantly designed buildings of Romanesque style with rounded arches. 15 Hillhouse was constructed for the Tyler Trust Association (Alpha Delta Fraternity) of Yale University (6). The building was home to the fraternity brothers from its construction up until 1930 when it was sold to the university. After it was sold, Yale leased it to the University Club from 1931 to 1934 and to York Hall (</span>Omicron Trust Association and Chi Phi) from 1935 to 1960 (6). Since 1960, the site has been home to the Yale Collection of Musical Instruments, an exhibition open and free to the public of musical instruments from antiquity to the present. </p><p><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>','<p><span style="color: black;">Originally Alpha Delta Phi fraternity, 15 Hillhouse Avenue was one of the very last buildings constructed on Hillhouse. Some of the architects of Hillhouse include Henry Austin, Ithiel Town and Alexander Jackson David (2). James Hillhouse planned the initial development of the street and helped establish at the time, the city’s image. He passed the plans and ideas onto his son, James A. Hillhouse (2)</span><em style="color: black;">. </em><span style="color: black;">Most of the houses, including the previously privately-owned ones and the buildings Yale has built, maintain residential characteristics.

Harp’s Renaissance Management Company, the title of the property was ‘sold’ for $0 to a new limited liability company, with Wendell Harp’s son Matthew as principal, in 2011, the year of the elder Mr. Harp’s death – a year in which Renaissance owed over $1 million in unpaid taxes.

On the front (east) façade, a steeply pitched gable roof – common among speculative housing projects of the 1880s – juts forward, its sharp angle accentuated by a projecting cornice held up by elongated, curvilinear brackets [7]. Small bosses and other relief ornamental notes adorn the ends of the cornice. A bay of two full sized windows and one half-sized window extends further from the main structure supported by a sequence of brackets. Above the windows and framed by the cornice, decorative scallops alternate with wood bands of shingles to give a subtle undulating texture to the otherwise horizontal forms. Clapboard set into rectangular panels surrounds the windows on either side. Another projecting bay emphasizes the entrance on the north side of the front façade. This bay likewise has a cornice that extends out of the elevation, with a similar scallop-and-line pattern beneath. Below the second gable, on the second story, is another full-sized window with clapboard on either side. Transitioning between the first and second stories, a bell-shaped skirt and triangular pediment lift the eye from the entrance porch up to the wood detailing of the second and third stories. The pediment gestures towards the Greek Revival style: dentils and incised brackets further decorate the entrance, and slender columns subtly support the overhanging bay. Wood details are painted a slate blue-gray, forming a pleasing juxtaposition with the main brick structure. The first-floor windows are tall and narrow, topped by a simple arched lintel. Thick horizontal elements frame the window from below. Finally, a thick, brown water table runs around the entire building, about two feet off the ground. (Architectural terminology pulled from [1].)&nbsp;</p><p>Building permits reveal few documented modifications to the structure since its construction; some interior alterations occurred in 1921, a fire escape was added in 1941, and the residence became a tenement in 1966. [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]</p><p>Garbage of various kinds litters the modest front yard.</p>','<p>Lynwood Place is a small, one-way residential street nestled between Elm Street and Edgewood Avenue. Lined with trees for its short, one-block span, Lynwood offers a reprieve from the bustling Broadway business district nearby. Architectural styles as varied as the simple rowhouse, the Italianate townhouse, and a Neo-Tudor house populate the streetscape, but the Queen Anne mode popular at the time of</p><p>Lynwood’s development in the late 19th century predominates [7]. </p><p>The homes on Lynwood Place are brick, as the street was developed shortly after the promulgation of new fire codes [1]. </p><p>Originally inhabited by professionals who worked at local businesses, Lynwood Pl. is now undoubtedly intertwined with Yale’s social fabric [8]. Residents of the block include Chabad at Yale, the Sigma Chi fraternity, the Nathan Hale Society, and members of Yale’s lightweight crew team. Indeed, as the university’s frontier has pushed westward, Yale has invested in better lighting for the street; Yale Security now patrols the street and monitors it with cameras [ibid.]. </p><p>Nearby streets were home to many of the communities of individuals who worked at the nearby carriage manufacturing plants [7]. See the “Site History” section for more information.</p>','<p>22 Lynwood Place is currently owned by 22 Lynwood LLC. The title to the property was transferred to 22 Lynwood LLC from Wendell C. Harp’s Renaissance Management Company in 2011 following Mr. Harp’s death. [9, 10]. Renaissance Management topped Connecticut’s Delinquent Taxpayer Accounts list for years with over $1 million tax liability in 2011, and it seems that the ownership restructuring may have been part of son Matthew Harp’s reforms of the family business [11]. 22 Lynwood LLC shares its corporate seat with Renaissance Management Company, and Matthew Harp remains the principal of 22 Lynwood LLC [12, 13]. Future researchers could consider further investigating this connection and the unfolding of new ownership of 22 Lynwood Place.</p><p>Renaissance acquired the property in August of 1974 for $54,000 [9]. Unfortunately, the tax records of the City of New Haven do not extend further back than this year; we can nevertheless piece together significant portions of the ownership history from building permits filed over the years. A permit from May 1982 cites Ed Bennett as the owner [6]; Mr. Bennett’s relationship to Renaissance Management is unclear. </p><p>In December of 1966, owner George Napels, who resided in North Haven at the time, filed a permit to convert the site to a tenement, i.e., a site occupied by three or more families [4]. Since 1966, the home has been a tenement-style rental, divided into three residential units.</p><p>Before Mr. Napels, Minnie Davis and her estate were the owners of 22 Lynwood, evidenced by building permits from 1941 and 1921 for the addition of a fire escape and interior alterations, respectively [2, 3]. No property line is visible between 22 Lynwood and 26 Lynwood on the 1924, 1964, and 1973 Sanborn Maps; both were owned by Wendell C. Harp and Renaissance Management Company from 1974 to 2011.</p><p>In 2011, 22 Lynwood LLC became the owner of 22 Lynwood Place, and in 2014 26 Lynwood LLC became the owner of 26 Lynwood Place. Perhaps future studies of 22 Lynwood Place should further investigate the connection between these two sites.</p><p>Details concerning the tenants of the building over time are murkier. Members of Yale Sailing have resided at 22 Lynwood since 2007, and it has significantly shaped the team’s social life. City directories over the years (e.g., 1913) have not consistently enumerated the residents of this. Some residents from 1927 and from 1970 are listed above, in “Past Tenants.” Unlike some of the neighboring homes, 22 Lynwood had telephone service by 1970 [14, 15, 16]. </p><p>Going back further in time, the home was not always inhabited by Yale students; before the home became a tenement, Maurice C. Resnik, an attorney, lived at 22 Lynwood in 1927. Lynwood Place has long been a haunt for Yale students, however. The History of the Yale College Class of 1908 and that of 1914 both mention students living on Lynwood Place during their time as undergraduates, as well as after graduation [17, 18].</p>','<p>Nearby streets were home to many of the communities of individuals who worked at the nearby carriage manufacturing plants. The Dwight Street Historic District was largely undeveloped until the 1820s. At that time, Elm Street (then known as Samaritan Street) “was marked by a scattered collection of lowly shacks” in which dwelt an impoverished African-American community working agricultural jobs at nearby farms [7, 19]. </p><p>Industry became an essential part of New Haven’s economy, and concomitant with the rise of the arms, hardware, and paper manufacturing businesses, the Town of New Haven set out a plan to connect these factories with northern New England and the St. Lawrence River by the development of a canal to Farmington. Population continued to grow in pace with the manufacturing economy, and speculators gobbled up large tracts of land around Dwight Street, hoping to capitalize on this growth by establishing new streets and homes [ibid.]. </p><p>In particular, the carriage manufacturing industry grew to be an essential component of New Haven’s economy; indeed, New Haven would soon be one of the global leaders of carriage manufacturing. Henry Hooker and John Osborne opened a carriage shop in 1827 across Park Street from present-day Davenport and Pierson Colleges. The Dwight Street neighborhood became an area for artisans and laborers, many of whom were employed at one of the nearby carriage factories. In 1880, the Hooker and Osborne Company sold land that would become the fashionable Lynwood Place, whose structures were built to comply with new fire codes [ibid.]. </p><p>The current home at 22 Lynwood Place was constructed between 1888 and 1897 [1]. Prior to its subdivision, the current plot of land on which 22 Lynwood Pl. sits was part of 12 Lynwood, and the street was known as Lynwood Street until the early 1920s [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25].</p>','<p>[1] New Haven Historic Resources Inventory, Dwight Area, (New Haven: The New Haven Preservation Trust, 1984), 522.</p><p>[2] Building Department of the City of New Haven.

Celentano, founder of the mortuary and former mayor of New Haven.&nbsp;</p>','<p>Martin Parrott (dates unknown)</p><p>Joseph &amp; Naomi Beecher (dates unknown)</p><p>Sidney Hull (dates unknown)</p><p>William Cutler (1836-1841)</p><p>John Richardson (1841-1894)</p><p>James Richardson (1894-1930)</p><p>Vacant (1930-1934)</p><p>Celentano Funeral Home (1934-Present)&nbsp;</p>','<p>The original John Richardson House (prior to its 1934 overhaul) possessed a marked Italianate silhouette with a pastiche of Greek Revival detailing. Characteristic of other Italianate homes, the Richardson House featured a flat, rectangular roof with a heavy cornice around the perimeter, in addition to an array of corniced windows featuring small scroll brackets. The building’s Greek Revival character is expressed largely through the columned portico framing the building’s entrance, which at the time of construction rose only a single story above the porch.</p><p>Some architectural historians have speculated that the John Richardson House may have been designed by the prolific New Haven architect Henry Austin, noting the original structure’s marked resemblance to other contemporaneous Italianate homes, such as the James Dwight Dana House at 24 Hillhouse Avenue, built a year later in 1845 (1).</p><p>The building’s 1934 renovation, under the oversight of Celentano Inc., divested it of some of its Italianate flair, when the heavy cornice on the roof was significantly trimmed, and the house’s square footprint became distended by a large single-story addition, more vernacular in style. In contrast, the building’s Greek Revival elements were heavily accentuated, and some critics would say were blown out of proportion (1). The entrance’s columned portico was raised to the height of the roof, doubling the height of the supporting Greek Revival columns, and a two- dimensional decorative pediment was affixed to added building’s otherwise visually sparse façade. During the renovation, the building’s exterior was stuccoed and the portico’s columns, formerly of painted wood, were replaced with aluminum.</p><p>Today, the interior of the Richardson House still boasts several traces of the original 1844 home, including three original marble fireplaces in addition to the original curving staircase and balustrade. However, some of the spacious parlors of the home have been segmented into separate rooms by 2000s-era additions of interior walls. In sum, the building remains an homage to 19th Century Italianate and Greek Revival houses, though its initial architectural vision has been somewhat muddled by a mélange of renovations.&nbsp;</p>','<p>Situated at the corner of Elm and Dwight streets, the John Richardson House/Celentano Funeral Home occupies a kind of liminal space between two contrasting neighborhoods: the upscale Broadway shopping and dining district that serves Yale’s campus and the Dwight-Dixwell residential neighborhood, mere blocks from downtown but a world away in terms of socioeconomic status as well as the physical appearance of the streetscape. At the time of the Richardson House’s construction in the mid-19th Century, Dwight Street was a promising new residential development, worthy of some of the finest Victorian and Italianate homes of the area, though it was at the same time emerging as a center for New Haven’s local industries, like the New Haven Carriage Co. and the F. H. Russell Lumber Yard, both situated just a stone’s throw from the Richardson House (3-6).</p><p>Now, however, most of the fine Victorian houses along Dwight Street, and indeed further along Elm Street, have been subdivided into multi-family and apartment-style housing. Many of these buildings now display marked physical and aesthetic deterioration, evincing this neighborhood’s decline in socioeconomic status and maintenance over the past decades (7, 8).</p><p>The Dwight neighborhood has been the locus of multiple redevelopment efforts by the New Haven Redevelopment Agency, most notably between 1965-1967, during which time the Celentano Funeral Home itself underwent a $115,000 capital improvement project recognized by the New Haven Redevelopment Agency (7, 8).&nbsp;</p>','<p>The building was commissioned in 1844 as a private residence for John Richardson, and ownership would remain in the Richardson family for nearly a century until 1930, having passed on to James Richardson upon his father’s death in 1894. City directories list the building as “vacant” from 1930-1934 as a result of the presumable death of James Richardson (9-12).</p><p>In 1934, the building was purchased by William C. Celentano, owner of the Celentano Funeral Home, which was at the time in operation next door at 434 Elm Street (11). Over the next year, Celentano would transition its operations from 434 Elm into 424 Elm, the John Richardson House. In order to accommodate operations as a funeral home, the house’s interior underwent a significant redesign, which included transforming living quarters into offices and enlarging interior doorways and arches (13). At this time, the building also underwent its drastic exterior remodel: flushboarded walls were stuccoed, cornices were trimmed, and the house’s elegant portico was inelegantly supersized (1). Although the 1934 redesign repurposed most of the residential areas of the home, it did preserve a second-floor residential apartment and kitchen, which for several decades housed Mr. and Mrs. Ralph and Josephine Marcarelli, longtime employees of the funeral home (14).</p><p>Since the building was rechristened as the Celentano Funeral Home in 1935, it has undergone multiple intervening additions, most notably the construction of an adjoining building in 1954, which more than doubled its floor space but which compromised the building’s Italianate symmetry and ornament (13). Other noteworthy additions include a 1940 porch to the building’s new entrance, a 1942 masonry garage, and a 1988 accessibility ramp (13). The funeral home remains to this day a family business; it is currently operated by William Celentano Jr. and Mark Celentano, the respective son and grandson of founder William C. Celentano, who started the company in 1924, and who would later serve as Mayor of New Haven from 1945-1953 (15). Memorabilia of William C. Celentano, including portraits and campaign posters, adorn the building’s interior as testament to the legacy he left as both a politician and a businessman.&nbsp;</p>','<p>According to the title deeds of the White Brothers, Clark, Hall, and Peck in Yale University’s library of Manuscripts &amp; Archives, the site of the John Richardson House had multiple successive owners (Martin Parrott, Joseph &amp; Naomi Beecher, and Sidney Hull) before it was purchased by William Cutler in 1834 (16). Unfortunately, these records bear no mention of any prior structures or buildings that might have stood on the site. John Richardson purchased the plot from Cutler in 1841, three years prior to the construction of the house. The same records show that John Richardson also purchased the property next door (now home to 434-436 Elm St.) in 1858, though he would sell this property, along with a slice of his 424 Elm property exactly 14 feet in width, to a Sarah Wier in 1870. Coincidentally, both of these properties formerly owned by John Richardson are now under the ownership of Celentano, Inc., the company that oversees the Celentano Funeral Home.</p><p>The John Richardson property also underwent multiple changes of address during this era, as was a typical occurrence in such a rapidly growing city as 19th Century New Haven. City directories from this time list the property as No. 34 Samaritan Street from 1845-47, No. 34 Mapel Street from 1848-1864, No. 250 Elm Street from 1865-1882, and finally No. 424 Elm Street from 1883 until the present (9-12, 17).&nbsp;</p>','<ol><li> Brown, Elizabeth Mills, <em>New Haven, a Guide to Architecture and Urban Design</em>.

Its most poignant features are its deeply-arched entrance, and its octagonal bay windows on the second and third floors, adding a sense of welcome or comfort to a building originally built as a living space for students. Designed by the architect Charles C. Haight, the building has 4.5 floors, and has an asymmetrical façade that clues viewers into its intriguing history: 493 College was originally part of its neighboring structure, 483 College Street (St. Anthony Hall) (2). The division of the building post-construction may provide some explanation as to why 493 College is unevenly distributed, with the right half of the building double the size of the left half of the building. Originally purposed as student dormitories for the undergraduate members of the society St. Anthony Hall, 493 College Street was purchased by Yale University in 1946 as part of its New College Plan to encourage students to live in the newly built residential colleges, and was repurposed into an administrative space thereafter (3). </p><p><br></p><p>In 2011, 493 College Street underwent a large-scale renovation with the goal of making the building more environmentally sustainable and wheel-chair accessible, before becoming the home of the Yale Sociology Department (4). Situated at the center of the Yale Central Complex, and at the center of heavy car and foot traffic, this eco-friendly building thus stands as a model of the urban future for New Haven (5). </p><p><br></p>','<p>From 1913, when the building was first erected, the space was used by undergraduate students who were members of the society St. Anthony Hall. 493 College Street was the space for student dormitories for these members (6). </p><p><br></p><p>In 1946, Yale University purchased 493 College Street from St. Anthony Hall, and adapted the space for office use and for administrative purposes. Since 1946, the building’s tenants have been university administrators, and professors who had their offices there (7). </p><p><br></p><p>In 2011, 493 College Street became the home of the Yale Sociology Department. They remain the building’s current tenants (8). </p><p><br></p>','<p>Designed by Charles C. Haight, 493 College Street is a classic example of the Late Gothic Revival Style, inspired by the likes of medieval architecture (9). With a sturdy iron and steel structure, the entire façade of the building is covered with cut white stone, lending the building a sense of stability and weight. </p><p><br></p><p>Immediately recognizable of this tall section building is its asymmetrical façade. The building, with its central axis marked by a “cross-gable pavilion with a deep-arched entrance flanked by small turrets with ogee domes,” is unevenly divided with an extra column of space on the right half of the building (10). Thus, the second and third floors of the right half of the building have two windows each, while the left half of the building has just one window on the two floors. This vertical asymmetry is further explained in the social history and site history sections below. Briefly: 493 College Street was originally built as a part of Saint Anthony Hall (483 College Street), the building next door. The two current-day buildings were historically one structure, and were divided in 1946 (11). Because the buildings were separated post-construction, the partition created an asymmetrical façade for 493 College Street. </p><p><br></p><p>The building also displays a 3:2:1 ratio, with the first floor, or base, of the building boasting great height. This also lends to a sense of stability in structure. On the first floor, the greatest feature on the façade is a wide English Decorated window with modernized detail. This is a feature that no other floor shares. </p><p><br></p><p>The second and third floors comprise the column of the building, and are smaller than the first floor. The two are identical in their facade features, creating a sense of replication. The two floors feature octagonal bay windows, commanding center attention. </p><p><br></p><p>The fourth story of the building, otherwise known as the capital, is separated from the rest of the section by a “projecting architrave below the sills”(12). This top floor, capped with a traditional gable roof, is treated as an attic, or frieze level.</p><p><br></p><p>Originally built for use as student dormitories for the undergraduate members of Saint Anthony Hall, one of Yale’s secret societies, the building has been repurposed for administrative functions, and now houses the Yale Sociology Department (13). As mentioned above, a partition was created to separate the two buildings. 493 College Street kept the original entrance, and a new entrance was built for neighboring 483 College Street. The interior of 493 College Street was also altered significantly—the student dormitories were removed, and in its place, administrative offices were set up. However, the arched entrance and foyer were kept and renovated to be in pristine condition. This provides a sense of grandeur when visitors first step into the building. In 2011, the building was renovated in line with the U.S. Green Building Council’s LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) rating system. The renovation project included increased ventilation to improve air quality and the indoor environment; the use of recycled and local materials to implement the renovations; the installation of low-flow toilets, pint-flush urinals, and low-flow kitchen faucets to improve water efficiency of the building; and the addition of a ramp at the exterior of the building to allow for wheelchair-accessibility at the main entrance (14).</p><p><br></p><p>A photo of 493 College Street’s façade, as well as photos of the interior of 493 College Street, are included below for reference.</p><p><br></p>','<p>493 College Street blends in with its general streetscape, as its architectural façade of cut white stone is identical to that of 483 College Street, and similar to that of Silliman College. The greenspace in front of the building is relatively bare, but there exists some greenery in the front lawn of the building. Plant species were specially selected to be native or adapted to the region. This was so that the plants would not require regular irrigation, and thus have no impact on the building’s overall water consumption (15). Thus, it seems that the planners of 493 College Street were very environmentally conscious about the way the building interacted and contributed to the environment. </p><p><br></p><p>Furthermore, 493 College Street is located at the center of the Yale Central Complex, especially with the openings of Yale’s two new residential colleges, making it situated at the center of a dense urban environment (16). Directly in front of the building is a busy two-way street, with heavy car traffic and foot traffic throughout the course of the day. Additionally, three Yale shuttle buses stop at two shuttle stops in close proximity to 493 College Street, making a total of 300 stops each weekday (17). This contributes to the population density around the urban setting of 493 College Street. </p><p><br></p>','<p>The original structure of 493 College Street was built as a part of 483 College Street, known as Saint Anthony Hall, a student society on campus. This society was first established in 1868 as one of several “Sheff clubs” founded by students of the Sheffield Scientific School who felt excluded from other societies when Yale College was split into two parts. A second society building was established in 1911, and remains to this day (18). This building was built with the generous donation of Frederick W. Vanderbilt, PH.B. 1876, for Saint Anthony Hall, and Charles C. Haight was the architect. The building was designed to blend in with its surrounding student dormitories.</p><p><br></p><p>The half of the building that is now 493 College Street was originally used as student dormitories for the members of Saint Anthony Hall. This was during an era of Yale history when students could live, and were encouraged to live in fraternity spaces, and the residential college system had not fully come into play (19). The demographics of these members were rather representative of the Yale student body in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century: all of the members were students of the Sheffield Scientific School and studied various STEM disciplines, many of the members were athletic and participated in sports such as crew and rowing, and many of the members came from sound financial backgrounds (20).</p><p><br></p><p>However, in the 1920s, the Yale University administration began to discuss the planning and implementation of the “New Yale College Plan,” which would create the system of undergraduate residential colleges famous to Yale today. This was prompted by the rapid diversification of the student body, and the growing rate of the College in this time period.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, in 1800, there were only 220 students enrolled in Yale. By 1899, enrollment was recorded at 1,200 students, and more than 3,000 students by the 1920s (21). Under the stress of this exponential growth rate, the adequacy of dormitory housing broke down, leaving many undergraduates to seek out their own living situations. Fraternities and secret societies, with living spaces offered as part of membership, thus became attractive options for students. In response to this growing problem, Edward S. Harkness, B.A. 1897, made a generous donation to Yale to create the residential college system in January of 1930. Emulating the college systems of Oxford and Cambridge, Harkness hoped to create residential college communities where faculty and students could live together, cultivating an intellectual environment inside and outside of class (22). In 1933, seven colleges: Branford, Calhoun, Davenport, Jonathan Edwards, Pierson, Saybrook, and Trumbull Colleges, opened under this New College Plan. In 1934, Berkeley College opened, and Timothy Dwight College opened the following year (23).</p><p><br></p><p>In 1940, Silliman College opened, and with its opening came an offer from the Yale University administration to The Anthony Trust Association—the organization that manages Saint Anthony Hall—to purchase the dormitory section of Saint Anthony Hall upon the completion of the College Plan. The university hoped to encourage fraternities and other social spaces on campus to turn towards living in the residential colleges, and contacted other societies as well, including Saint Elmo’s. This would allow for quicker consolidation and implementation of the New College Plan, and would allow for Harkness’ vision to come to fruition: a residential system where students could engage academically and intellectually with others and faculty even after class, whether in the dining hall or the dormitories (24). With specific regards to the property of 493 College Street, Yale University hoped to use the space for administrative purposes relating to Silliman College. After much negotiation between the Yale administration and the Anthony Trust Association, the following agreement was made in 1946:</p><p><br></p><p>“Upon completion of the present College Plan, that is to say, when Yale University shall have rooming facilities in its several Colleges sufficient for the housing of substantially all undergraduates other than those residing at their homes in New Haven and vicinity…St. Anthony will execute and deliver to Yale University a proper deed without covenants conveying in fee simple the northerly or dormitory portion of its property" (25).</p><p><br></p><p>The conditions the two parties agreed on include: (1) Yale University will pay the taxes of St. Anthony Hall for ten years after the sale; (2) Yale University will cover heat and electricity for St. Anthony Hall for ten years after the sale; (3) Yale University will construct and pay for the partition that will separate the building and divide it into two; and (4) Yale University will commemorate the transaction with St. Anthony Hall with a plaque of acknowledgement to both the society and its benefactor, Frederick William Vanderbilt (26). This plaque still stands in the foyer of 493 College Street, and is pictured below.</p><p><br></p><p>Since the turning over of 493 College Street to Yale University, the building has mainly functioned as an administrative space: first for dormitory administration of Silliman College, and then as various office spaces for professors (27). In 2011, after the large-scale renovation of the building mentioned above in “Physical Description,” the building became the home of the Yale Sociology Department (28). Today, there are a number of seminar classrooms on the first floor of the building. The remaining floors are offices for professors in the Sociology Department.</p>','<p>Though Saint Anthony Hall was first founded as a society in 1868, the location in which 493 College Street was an empty lot until the construction of the society’s first building in 1884. This Society Hall is pictured on the corner of College Street and Wall Street in the 1886 New Haven Sanborn Map (29). This first building was eventually replaced with the structure still standing today in 1911, when Frederick William Vanderbilt generously donated to the cause of St. Anthony Hall for the construction of a new building. Designed by Charles C. Haight, construction of the building finished in 1913. This building is displayed on the 1924 New Haven Sanborn Map (30). </p><p><br></p><p>In 1940, Yale University and The Anthony Trust Association were in deep conversation about the turning over of St. Anthony Hall’s dormitories to the university as part of the New College Plan. Details were finalized and signed in 1946. Plans were delayed until after the conclusion of World War II, but the Mott-Mohr Construction Company was eventually tasked with the planning and building of the partition. The 1973 Sanborn Map depicts 483 College Street and 493 College Street as separate entities (31). </p><p><br></p><p>In 2011, 493 College Street underwent a large-scale renovation in line with the U.S. Green Building Council’s LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) rating system (32). The details of the renovation are mentioned above in the “Physical Description” section. The purpose of the renovation was to make the building more environmentally sustainable, as well as wheel-chair accessible. </p><p><br></p>','<p>[1] Ryan, Susan, “493 College Street,” <em>Historic Resources Inventory Building and Structures: State of Connecticut Historical Commission,</em> August 15, 1980. </p><p>[2] <em>Ibid</em>.</p><p>[3] “Correspondence between President Charles Seymour and The Anthony Trust Association: Box 141,” <em>Guide to the Charles Seymour, President of Yale University, Records</em>, 1940-1946.</p><p>[4] “493 College Street,” <em>Yale Office of Sustainability</em>, Accessed February 22, 2018., <a href="https://sustainability.yale.edu/sites/default/files/college493-120726.pdf" target="_blank">https://sustainability.yale.edu/sites/default/files/college493-120726.pdf</a> </p><p>[5] <em>Ibid</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>[6] Richards, David Alan, <em>Skull and Keys: The Hidden History of Yale’s Secret Societies</em>, (New York: Pegasus Books, 2017), 67.</p><p>[7] “Correspondence between President Charles Seymour and The Anthony Trust Association: Box 141,” <em>Guide to the Charles Seymour, President of Yale University, Records</em>, 1940-1946.</p><p>[8] “493 College Street,” <em>Yale Office of Sustainability</em>, Accessed February 22, 2018., <a href="https://sustainability.yale.edu/sites/default/files/college493-120726.pdf" target="_blank">https://sustainability.yale.edu/sites/default/files/college493-120726.pdf</a> </p><p>[9] Ryan, Susan, “493 College Street,” <em>Historic Resources Inventory Building and Structures: State of Connecticut Historical Commission,</em> August 15, 1980. </p><p>[10] <em>Ibid</em>.</p><p>[11] “Correspondence between President Charles Seymour and The Anthony Trust Association: Box 141,” <em>Guide to the Charles Seymour, President of Yale University, Records</em>, 1940-1946.</p><p>[12] <em>Ibid</em>.</p><p>[13] “493 College Street,” <em>Yale Office of Sustainability</em>, Accessed February 22, 2018., <a href="https://sustainability.yale.edu/sites/default/files/college493-120726.pdf" target="_blank">https://sustainability.yale.edu/sites/default/files/college493-120726.pdf</a> </p><p>[14] <em>Ibid</em>.</p><p>[15] “493 College Street,” <em>Yale Office of Sustainability</em>, Accessed February 22, 2018., <a href="https://sustainability.yale.edu/sites/default/files/college493-120726.pdf" target="_blank">https://sustainability.yale.edu/sites/default/files/college493-120726.pdf</a> </p><p>[16] Brown, Elizabeth Mills, <em>New Haven: A Guide to Architecture and Urban Design: 15 Illustrated Tours</em>, (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1976), 27-32. </p><p>[17] <em>Ibid</em>.</p><p>[18] Richards, David Alan, <em>Skull and Keys: The Hidden History of Yale’s Secret Societies</em>, (New York: Pegasus Books, 2017), 34-38.</p><p>[19] <em>Ibid</em>.</p><p>[20] <em>Ibid</em>.</p><p>[21] Osborn, Robert C. “’Student-Faculty Table,’ the College Plan,” 1953, Accessed February 19, 2018, <a href="http://www.library.yale.edu/mssa/YHO/Piersons/resCollege_Coed.html" target="_blank">http://www.library.yale.edu/mssa/YHO/Piersons/resCollege_Coed.html</a> </p><p>[22] “Yale History Timeline: 1930-1939,” <em>Yale University Library</em>, Accessed February 19, 2018, <a href="https://guides.library.yale.edu/c.php?g=296074&amp;p=1976342" target="_blank">https://guides.library.yale.edu/c.php?g=296074&amp;p=1976342</a> </p><p>[23] <em>Ibid</em>.</p><p>[24] “Correspondence between President Charles Seymour and The Anthony Trust Association: Box 141,” <em>Guide to the Charles Seymour, President of Yale University, Records</em>, 1940-1946.</p><p>[25] <em>Ibid</em>.</p><p>[26] <em>Ibid</em>.</p><p>[27] “493 College Street,” <em>Yale Office of Sustainability</em>, Accessed February 22, 2018., <a href="https://sustainability.yale.edu/sites/default/files/college493-120726.pdf" target="_blank">https://sustainability.yale.edu/sites/default/files/college493-120726.pdf</a> </p><p>[28] Griswold, Alison, “Sociology Department Home At Last,” <em>Yale Daily News</em>, September 2, 2011, Accessed February 19, 2018, <a href="https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2011/09/02/sociology-dept-home-at-last/" target="_blank">https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2011/09/02/sociology-dept-home-at-last/</a>. </p><p>[29] New Haven Sanborn Map 1886.</p><p>[30] New Haven Sanborn Map 1924.</p><p>[31] New Haven Sanborn Map 1973.</p><p>[32] “493 College Street,” <em>Yale Office of Sustainability</em>, Accessed February 22, 2018., <a href="https://sustainability.yale.edu/sites/default/files/college493-120726.pdf" target="_blank">https://sustainability.yale.edu/sites/default/files/college493-120726.pdf</a>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>');

Duffy, St. Elmo Society</p>','<p>35 Lynwood Place uses a medium to dark brick to create a straightforward Italianate home. It is clearly a intended as a residential structure as the small wooden stoop and sharp triangular cover over the entryway that is commonly seen in both Italianate and Queen Anne style architecture (the other source of inspiration for the house). Apart from the humbly ornamented entryway, the front of the house is completely flat with three windows. The windows are framed with white wood, and there is a bending curve in the border along the top edge of each of the windows. These gentle arcs lend themselves to the general theme of humility among more complex architectural structures on the street. The roof of the house is also gabled, but in a way that is difficult to see from the street level. The roof adds to the idea that the architect or family commissioning its construction intended to draw less attention to home than its neighbors. But despite its simple themes and details, the house and the small garden immediately in front of it are handsome and there is nothing garish or unpleasant about them.&nbsp;</p>','<p>35 Lynwood Pl is surrounded by other residential houses. Many of these homes were built in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century as the residential area of New Haven expanded out from the green. This urban development is shown by the 1879 and 1889 Sanborn Maps. Most houses on the street are designed in Italianate or Greek revival style with the ornamentation that alludes to the wealthy families that would have been moving into the houses when they were built. The house is also less than a block from the commercial district of Broadway, giving it increasing value as a quiet residential street in an ideal location.&nbsp;</p>','<p>Built in 1885 as a single-family home, 35 Lynwood is a shining example of the expansion of New Haven’s residential area in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century. When the development of Lynwood started to occur in the 1880’s, its single-family homes were occupied by the successful professionals who either owned businesses in New Haven or were associated with Yale. Lynwood place and its homes were an outlier in the original development of the Dwight Neighborhood, as it was traditionally working class.<a href="#_ftn1" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[1]</a> These new Lynwood Place homes were primarily brick, to comply with the city’s new fire codes.<a href="#_ftn2" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[2]</a> While these homes were originally, single family, the nature of the street changed again as the dense urban area of New Haven spread. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nicest homes on Lynwood remained private residences, while the smaller brick homes like 35 Lynwood became leased apartments, frequently for people associated with Yale. The major change for 35 Lynwood came in 1985, when the St. Elmo Society Alumni board purchased the house. St. Elmo Society had been founded in 1889 as one of the Sheffield Scientific School Societies, similarly to Book and Snake and Berzelius.<a href="#_ftn3" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[3]</a> It was originally open to sophomores, juniors, and seniors, until roughly the 1960s, after the Sheffield School became officially a part of Yale, changed its membership process. Elmo’s then became a senior society that operated in the traditional manner of Yale senior societies. Originally, the St. Elmo’s tomb was located at 111 Grove Street and was built in 1885, until moved to a new tomb right next door at 109 Grove Street, what was then known as St. Elmo’s hall and now known as Rosenfeld Hall. The building was designed and built by Kenneth Murchison and reflected an Elizabethan style.<a href="#_ftn4" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[4]</a></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original arrangement at St. Elmo hall, was that the society leased dormitory space to the Yale. That changed in 1962 when the University purchased the building from St. Elmo and began leasing the University’s space to the society. The final chapter of the story began when in 1985 Yale opted not to renew St. Elmo’s lease on the space in what had been renamed Rosenfeld Hall. It was then that the St. Elmo’s alumni corporation purchased the new tomb at 35 Lynwood Place. To this day, the mission of St Elmo is to “shape the lives of its members, providing a close knit community and sense of fellowship, and facilitating their personal development so that they go on to make positive and profound impacts in their communities and the world at large."<a href="#_ftn5" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[5]</a> The story of the St. Elmo’s tomb speaks to a larger shift of the University purchasing senior society tombs and repurposing them to fit the larger needs of the University. While some societies like Skull and Bones, Berzelius, Book and Snake, Scroll and Key, and Wolf’s Head still have ostentatious, architecturally impressive tombs, most have moved on to simpler more residential homes to conduct their society meetings. </p><p><em>&nbsp;</em></p><p><br></p><p>  <a href="#_ftnref1" target="_blank">[1]</a> US Dept. of the Interior.

Haight, is the current home of the Yale society known as St. Anthony Hall (1). The building is St. Anthony Hall’s third building and second on the current site (2). The building sits on the northeast corner of College and Wall Streets, with large tower on the corner that is flanked on each side by lower-rise sections of the building. Frederick W. Vanderbilt donated funds for the building and it was constructed in the Late Gothic Revival out of cut limestone in order to match the two Sheffield School dormitories that neighbor it on both College and Wall Streets, which were also donated by Vanderbilt. It was, at the time of its building, the “most expensive and elaborate secret society building in the United States” according to the New York Times (3).</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;The original building consisted of both of what are now 483 College Street and 493 College Street, but 493, which held most of the fraternity living quarters, was sold to the University in 1945 in order to defray maintenance costs after the University banned students from living in fraternities and societies (4). Today, St. Anthony Hall is home to the day-to-day operations of the society as well as many special events, including a fall lecture series and the annual Pump and Slipper Ball.</p>','<p>The tower of St. Anthony Hall makes a prominent statement to passersby of the corner of Wall and College Streets. It is one of the tallest structures for blocks around it, with competition coming only from the tower of Sheffield-Sterling-Strathcona Hall a block north. But while St. Anthony Halls tower marks the landscape, in some ways the building is hidden in plain sight. As intended, the building’s Late Gothic Revival styling blends in with the better-known Silliman College that surrounds it on either side. The cut limestone of the exterior of St. Anthony Hall matches that of the Silliman dormitories on College and Wall Streets. The Georgian elements on the college are not visible from these angles.</p><p><br></p><p>Charles C. Haight, the architect of the building, employs a juxtaposition of ornamented and simple elements up and down the building. He contrasts multi-panel pointed arch windows on the ground floor with simpler square and rounded arch window opening further up the tower. The top of the tower reflects the ornate style of the bottom, with Haight employing a variety of empty niches to draw attention to the topmost level. “St. Anthony Hall” is engraved above the current front door and the Greek letters ΔΨ overlook the ornamental iron gate that sits diagonally facing the intersection. This gate, designed by Heins and La Farge, was part of the second St. Anthony Hall building, which stood at the present site and was also designed by Heins and La Farge (5).</p><p><br></p><p>The original building comprised both 483 College Street and what is now known as the Yale Sociology Department at 493 College Street. Upon competition of the “college plan,” Yale students were no longer allowed to live in fraternities and societies. As a result, the Anthony Trust Associate, which owns St. Anthony Hall, chose to sell a portion of the building, which previously held the majority of the building’s residential rooms, to the University (6). As part of the transaction, the University paid for a number of physical modifications to the building, including constructing a dividing wall between the two properties and building a new entrance to the building where the current main entrance is today.&nbsp;</p>','<p>Members of St. Anthony Hall lived in the building until 1946 and US Military officers lived and worked in the building during World War II</p>','<p>Founded in 1868, St. Anthony Hall, also known as the Sigma Chapter of Delta Psi, was one of a slew of Greek letter organizations that were founded at Yale between 1865 and 1890 (7). Membership in St. Anthony Hall was restricted to members of the Sheffield School. St. Anthony Hall and other Sheffield Societies played an especially important role on campus given the lack of sufficient dormitories owned by the school itself. The eight fraternities and societies housed over three hundred students of the Sheffield School (8).</p><p><br></p><p>While this was originally a boon to the school, Yale soon began to resent the two-tier status created by those living in the societies. As a result, Yale began to build residential colleges in the spirit of those at Oxford and Cambridge in the 1930s. As part of this plan, the University president at the time, Charles Seymour, decided to ban undergraduates from living in societies and fraternities. This posed a problem for St. Anthony Hall, which gained much of its revenue from income from the rent of members living in the building. As a result, John C. Greenleaf, the chairman of the Anthony Trust Association at the time, brokered a deal in 1939 to sell the dead to the north-most part of the building to Yale (9). This transaction finalized in 1946 after the end of the war and the completion of the college plan. Yale turned this section of the building into what is now the Sociology Department at 493 College Street.</p><p><br></p><p>During the war, with so many of its members serving overseas, St. Anthony Hall was home to members of the military who were stationed on campus for recruiting efforts. Army officers lived and worked out of these quarters (10).</p><p><br></p><p>Today, St. Anthony Hall is still home to the operations of the society, although no one lives in the building today. In addition to society operations, the society holds an annual fall lecture series as well as other special events throughout the years, including the annual Pump and Slipper Ball, which has been held for over a century and is mentioned in a number of short stories by F. Scott Fitzgerald.</p>','<p>The Anthony Trust Association purchased the land where St. Anthony Hall sits today circa 1893 (11). In the same year, a Richardsonian brownstone building designed by Heins and La Farge was built on the property as the second building for St. Anthony Hall, which had its original building at 43 College Street (although this addressing system is no longer in use) (12, 13). By 1901, additional residence halls had been added to the original building in order to house the membership (14).</p><p><br></p><p>The brownstone building and accompanying additions were torn down to make way for the present building around 1913 to allow for additional space for the membership and to match the newly constructed Sheffield dormitories on either side, which were built from 1903-1906 (15).</p><p><br></p><p>In 1939, the Anthony Trust Association agreed to sell part of the building and corresponding land to the University at the completion of the “college plan.” This exchanged occurred on January 1<sup>st</sup>, 1946. A dividing wall was put in place by the University to divide the two plots (16).</p>','<p>Sitting strikingly on the corner of College and Wall Streets, St. Anthony Hall marked by the south-most corner of the Sheffield School, its tower overlooking the lower buildings of the college to the south and west. St. Anthony Hall, connecting the two Vanderbilt Dormitories on either side of it, now part of Silliman College, created an L-shape, which in a way isolated the Sheffield school behind it from the College. Across the street, the Scroll and Key society building sits in stark contrast as representative of the split in historical society function between the College and Sheffield. Scroll and Key, with its windowless tomb-like design, is very clearly exclusively a building for society ritual. The windowed visage of St. Anthony Hall in contrast is as much a society building as it is a dormitory for Sheffield students.</p><p><br></p><p>Today, St. Anthony Hall is often unnoticed, blending in as planed with the better-known Silliman College around it, unlike other society tombs on campus. Even in this relatively anonymous position, the tower of the building is still a striking landmark of the Yale campus and emphasizes the Yale-dominated central campus, despite not technically being a Yale-own building itself.</p>','<p>1.

In total, it is 38,500 square feet (12). The exterior consists of a combination of brick, stucco, and glass windows (12). The structure itself is load-bearing masonry, specifically brick, and the roof is flat with T&amp;G/rubber material (12). The interior consists of 40 units, including studio, one bedroom, two bedroom, and three bedroom apartments, as well as an elevator (11). The units consist of drywall/plaster walls, and either carpet or hardwood floors (11 and 12). The building is primarily Spanish / Mission Revival, due to its stucco exterior, flat roof, front porch, and small balconies in the front and back of the building (11 and 12). </span></p><p><span style="color: windowtext;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: windowtext;">The building has changed forms over time. When it was built in the mid-19th century, it had a simple L shaped form, with the majority of the building facing the street and the south side jutting behind the building (4). Prior to 1912, there was an additional storage space behind the main building (6 and 7). In 1912, it was renovated to be an apartment building (1). By 1924, the second building behind the main building had been torn down and replaced by private garages for automobiles (8).</span></p>','<p><span style="color: windowtext;">Harrison Court is situated on Park Street in between two residential buildings (Orleton Court and the Dinmore apartment buildings), and down the street from a Dunkin’ Donuts. It faces Yale’s Pierson College, the Yale Cabaret, and the Yale Afro-American Cultural Center (AFAM House). Just steps away from Chapel Street and the Yale campus, Harrison Court integrates the Yale community into the rest of New Haven’s restaurants, offices, and other retail buildings.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: windowtext;">&nbsp;</span></p>','<p><span style="color: windowtext;">Prior to 1912, 210 Park Street was reserved primarily for industrial use. Around 1867, it was built to house the Mathushek Piano Manufacturing Company, which produced grand pianos and was run by Frederick Mathushek (4). It was then sold to the Jacobs Brothers Piano Company in 1875, but still continue to operate under the name Mathushek Piano Manufacturing Company until the company moved permanently to New York in the late 19th century (4).</span></p><p><span style="color: windowtext;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: windowtext;">By 1886, the Sanborn Maps show that the Newman and Sons Corset Manufactory was a tenant in the building (6). This represents the greater setting of Park Street as an industrial area of the city, as 210 Park Street was one of many other factories in the neighborhood (6 and 7).</span></p><p><span style="color: windowtext;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: windowtext;">By 1901, the Sanborn Maps show that the property owner was C.H. Bird, a New Haven resident. It appears that the main building on Park Street housed many tenants, including a machine shop, candy factory, tailor, ice house, screw plating business, shipping and mixing room, and food companies (7). In the additional building behind&nbsp;the main one held the Stinerson Company, Dealers in Pianos (7).</span></p><p><span style="color: windowtext;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: windowtext;">By 1911, the building was owned by the New Haven Real Estate and Power Company (10). The next year, in 1912, the building was officially renovated to its current structure as an apartment building called Harrison Court (1). Although it maintained its L-shape, it added a patio and eliminated storage space to make room for automobile garages (7 and 8). This contributes to the broader trend of the city and America as a whole of the rising influence of transportation on our architecture (3).</span></p><p><span style="color: windowtext;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: windowtext;">In 1965, Yale bought the building and currently partners with property management company Elm Campus Partners to lease apartments to students (11 and 12). </span></p><p><span style="color: windowtext;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: windowtext;">By converting itself from commercial use to residence, Harrison Court helps to both define and blur the line between the Yale campus and the city of New Haven. As an off-campus residence for Yale students, but also in close proximity to Pierson College and other Yale buildings, allowing it to serve as a bridge between the Yale and New Haven community. Especially as Pierson and Davenport colleges were built in the 1930s, it completely changed the character of the street from industrial to residential (5).&nbsp;</span></p>','<p>As Park Street was developing in the later half of the 19th century, most of the buildings were constructed for the purpose of manufacturing, and 210 Park Street was no different (6 and 7). This likely contributed to the rising commercial interests of New Haven, and provided businesses for New Haven residents to shop for their everyday needs.&nbsp;The business owners of the manufacturers that it housed, rather than the adjacent Yale, owned the building, which showed that there was likely much of a divide between the city and college. Over time, as more transportation methods were made available to residents, the commercial and industrial interests of the city were moved outside to provide a more residential function for the city and especially the Yale campus. It is also interesting to note that over time, the manufacturing buildings were replaced by apartments and a Catholic church, which definitely characterized the street as a less commercial and more residential space (8 and 9).</p>','<p><span style="background-color: white;">1.

Over the last century, this building has not only housed dozens of families, but also nurtured the entrepreneurial dreams of small business owners. Today, the passerby peers into the storefront, sees the artistry of a Skull &amp; Combs hairdresser, but, quickly becomes distracted by the buzzing activity of I-91 and the aromas of De Legna’s kitchen.</p>','2.5','29\'3" x 53\'10"','<p>1907 – Samuel A.

The exterior of the building is currently accentuated by beige vinyl siding and trim, which was installed between 2008 and 2011 by Zofia Pupa (4 and 17). In re-siding the house, Mr. Pupa replaced the aluminum siding Mitchell Rozycki installed back in 1959 (18). Today, as the passerby’s eyes wander up the structure they are met by sashed windows that have been stripped of their shutters. Ascending, the passerby’s gaze comes across the plain bargeboards, which are tucked under the lip of the steep, cross gabbled roof. The passerby’s gaze descends from here and is met abruptly by the first story commercial storefront that masks what would have been the houses original front, which looked similar to the neighbor’s house at 834 State Street. This addition to the building would have come around 1914, which records show is when Aniello Vegliante filed for a permit to carry out a brick extension to the storefront (19). Approximately three decades later, Nicholas Vegliante remodels the storefront with carrara glass and extends the brick wall on the store’s side in order to enclose the front steps of the residence (20). Further improvements to this storefront are done in 1965, when Mr. Rozycki files a permit with New Haven City Hall so that he can erect new brick base aluminum veneer (21).</p>','<p class="ql-align-justify">As the passerby walks along State Street, this building will appear on the street’s western side, between Pearl and Clark Street. Situated across from it is the Citizens Television, Inc. building. Both of these structures are in a neighborhood that is characterized by its residential, commercial, and industrial architecture. Most notably, the building at 832 State Street is in walking distance of a number of New Haven’s most celebrated restaurants, including Modern Apizza, De Legna’s, and L’Orcio.</p>','<p class="ql-align-justify">Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, State Street developed so to include a conglomeration of wharves, shops, and wealthy merchants’ houses. In the 1840s, the new mobility offered by the railroad caused a shift in the residential and retail spaces of the city, thereby propping up the State Street area as the first wholesale district. By the end of the 19th century, this area was dotted with residences, second-hand furniture stores, and numerous Italian markets (22). Around 1900, Max Straus built the building that can now be found at 832 State Street on an undeveloped lot that he purchased in 1889 from Joel W.S. Peck. Mr. Straus rented out 21⁄2 stories of this building before selling it to Annie Elizabeth Mower in 1907 (1). Mrs. Mower and her husband, who worked as the superintendent of a saw company known as the H.G. Thompson Company, lived in the home through the first decade of the twentieth century (5). During the early 1910s, another resident, Aniello Vegliante, added a storefront to the building (19). This new addition to house offered Mr. Vegliante the opportunity to practice his craft as a shoe cobbler. In 1925, Mr. Vegliante welcomed a new tenant, Richard Lewis – a painter (6). By 1930, Margaret A. Sullivan joined Vegliante in the storefront, where she would set up shop as a hairdresser (7). Ten years later, Mrs. Sullivan moved out, which created space for Mr. Markoff, who was a tailor (8). After 1950, most of these tenants relocated and Joseph C. Gillette moved into the house. In making use of the storefront, Mr. Gillette ran and operated the Gillette Department Store (9). A decade later, the new property owner, Mitchell Rozycki, transforms the storefront into the Rozycki Travel Agency (10). Mr. Rozycki, who was also a real estate agent, lived in this house with his family between 1960 and 1990, during which a number of other tenants moved in and out (11, 12 and 13). By 1990, the property was signed over to Steven Pupa (14). Shortly thereafter, the Rozycki Travel Agency closed for business. More recent records show that the storefront was occupied by an enterprise known as “The Serene Spot,” which offered therapeutic massages and bodywork (15). Today however, the building’s commercial space is occupied by a successful hair salon that has ingeniously been named, “Skull &amp; Combs Co.” (16). </p>','<p><span style="color: black;">The lot that this building currently sits on was owned by Joel W.S. Peck during the late 19th century. In 1889, Mr. Peck sold the lot, which had been undeveloped, to Max Straus. Mr. Straus would build the house that now exists there around 1900 before selling the property to Annie Elizabeth Mower in 1907 (1). </span></p>','<p>1.

It is currently the location of Mory’s, an exclusive restaurant and bar for members of the Yale community. In around 1817, the building was constructed. It is one of the few Federal-style buildings remaining in New Haven. Although the building has been altered a few times, it still is exemplary of the Federal style of architecture.&nbsp;It originally served as a single-family home until it became the location of Mory’s in around 1912. The site now serves as one of the most renowned collegiate social clubs in the country with many traditions that still remain today.</p>','<p>	306 York Street is a single-family home built some time before 1817. The building is classified as a <span style="background-color: yellow;">Federal</span> style of architecture. It is a <span style="background-color: yellow;">gable-end</span>, <span style="background-color: yellow;">side-hall</span> house with <span style="background-color: yellow;">molded cornice</span>, and a <span style="background-color: yellow;">fanlight attic window</span>. It has a <span style="background-color: yellow;">3-bay façade</span> with <span style="background-color: yellow;">molded window frames</span>, each of which have <span style="background-color: yellow;">abbreviated entablature</span> and <span style="background-color: yellow;">projecting cornice</span> above. On the north side of the building, there is a fence, a gate, and a small courtyard connecting the site with Yale University’s Hall of Graduate Studies. There is also a <span style="background-color: yellow;">Victorian</span> iron fence around the front yard. In 1923, the building was first altered with an addition that was constructed in the rear of the building. The Office of Douglas Orr, who was a Yale graduate with a degree in architecture, was then built in 1960. Soon after, in 1976, there were interior renovations to the building. Originally a feature of a previous Mory’s location on Temple Street, a Federal-style entrance porch with decorative features, such as <span style="background-color: yellow;">paterae</span> and <span style="background-color: yellow;">bead molding</span>, was added to the site in the 20<sup>th</sup> century after 306 York Street became the new site of Mory’s. At this time, the building was renovated with many other elements from the building on Temple Street, including new window and door <span style="background-color: yellow;">casings</span>, <span style="background-color: yellow;">wainscoting</span>, and <span style="background-color: yellow;">fireplace mantels</span>. The interior also featured pictures, decorations, tables, and memorabilia from the previous location. There are three dining rooms, a kitchen, and office space on the ground floor of the building, On the second level, there are five private dining rooms and a library that contains books and collectables about Yale and Mory’s. Despite the numerous alterations to the building, 306 York Street remains to have a relationship with various Federal-style buildings surrounding Yale’s campus, including 80 Broadway, 66 Wall Street, and 459 College Street.</p>','<p>Located in a central area of Yale’s campus, Mory’s is surrounded by buildings that serve many different purposes. It is situated near a row of commercial buildings from the early twentieth century. While facing the building, you will see one of New Haven’s most well-known nightclubs, Toad’s Place, on the left of Mory’s. On the right, is Yale’s Hall of Graduate Studies, displaying Late Gothic Revival and Modernistic styles of architecture. Across the street from the establishment is the Sterling Memorial Library, which also embodies a Late Gothic Revival style. On York Street, it is clear that the buildings exhibit many different styles of architecture which create a unique and exciting urban setting.</p>','<p>The Mory’s building is a staple within the Yale community. However, before the building became Mory’s, it served as a single-family home. The original owner of the house is unknown, but the first known homeowner is E.L. Richards. Later, Wilbur Cross, Yale’s famous graduate dean, occupied the home, followed by Clive Day and the Ross and Harrison families.</p><p>Mory’s has a history that began before the purchase of 306 York Street. In the early 1860s, Mr. and Mrs. Frank Moriarty established the bar at 103 Wooster Street, and it became a popular site for Yale students due to their characteristic hospitality. The establishment was then relocated quite frequently in future years. In the late 1860s, the Moriarty’s relocated their business to a brick, Italianate residence on Court Street and called it “The Quiet House”. In 1876, Frank Moriarty passed away, and his wife decided to move the institution again to a Federal house closer to Yale’s campus on Temple Street. At this new location, the name of the business was changed to “Mory’s Temple Bar.” When Mrs. Moriarty passed away in 1885, Edward G. Oakley, a previous waiter in the bar, took over the business. Despite the change in leadership, the business was still owned by the Moriarty estate. Oakley was a poor manager, and he lost the lease in 1898. An experienced individual, Louis Linder, took over the lease and completely revived the business. He offered the site as a meeting place for Yale’s singing groups. In fact, one of Yale’s most famous a cappella groups, the Whiffenpoofs, was founded in the Temple Bar in 1909. In the early twentieth century, the future of the establishment was vulnerable due to Linder’s old age and redevelopment plans. So, in 1912, Attorney Arnon A. Alling organized a group of Yale alumni to purchase Linder’s interest and integrated the enterprise as a club. Around this time, 306 York Street was purchased for this establishment and significantly altered to include elements from the building on Temple Street. </p><p>Mory’s is a popular site for individuals within the Yale community. The club is only accessible to people with a membership, which is offered to students, alumni, individuals in New Haven who are affiliated with Yale, and employees. Since Mory’s has been around for such a long time, it has many traditions that are still active today. As previously mentioned, the Whiffenpoofs, an a cappella group composed of all-male senior Yale students, was founded at Mory’s. The group sings weekly at Mory’s in the dining areas of the establishment. Another one of the most renowned traditions is the cup. The cup is a large silver trophy filled with alcohol and is shared within a group. The way in which people drink out of the cup is unique. There is a specific way that the people must pass the cup, and when the drink is about to be finished, the last person must completely get rid of any moisture in the cup. The last person to drink out of the cup also usually puts the large cup upside down on their head. Even after so many years, Mory’s still remains to be one of the most fun and meaningful places for members of the Yale community.</p>','<p>Since 306 York Street was built such a long time ago, it is difficult to figure out what the lot was before the building was constructed there. Since 306 York Street is the same size and visible on each of the Sanborn maps, it is highly likely that the home was the first building constructed in that area. The New Haven Sanborn maps show the transformation of the urban landscape surrounding 306 York Street. For example, in the 1886 and 1901 Sanborn maps, the whole strip that currently is occupied by Toad’s Place, Donut Crazy, Blue State Coffee, and other stores does not even exist on the map. There is just empty land shown at that area. However, the 1924 Sanborn maps show buildings in that area. Buildings numbered 290 through 300 are now on the map in addition to a pass way, which still remains today, in between 300 York Street and 306 York Street. There is also a large high school with a connecting gymnasium behind 306 York Street, which is shown on the 1924 Sanborn map. The 1973 Sanborn map is a more accurate representation to what the area looks like now. Yale’s Hall of Graduate Studies is constructed right next to 306 York Street. Also, Yale’s Ezra Stiles College and Morse College are built right behind 306 York Street (where the high school previously mentioned was located). The transformation demonstrates how Yale’s campus has expanded over time. It is interesting to see how 306 York Street was shown on the Sanborn maps dating back to 1886, but the surrounding urban area has changed rapidly throughout time.</p>','<p>“About Us.” <em>Mory’s Association</em>, 	www.morys1849.org/Default.aspxp=DynamicModule&amp;pageid=23&amp;ssid=100037&amp;vnf=1.</p><p><br></p><p>“About Us.” <em>Whiffenpoofs</em>, www.whiffenpoofs.com/about-us/.</p><p><br></p><p>“Asset Detail.” <em>National Parks Service</em>, U.S. Department of the Interior, npgallery.nps.gov/NRHP/AssetDetail?assetID.</p><p><br></p><p>Historic Resources Inventory Building and Structures – Connecticut Historical Commission (306 York Street)</p><p><br></p><p>Reilly, Laura. “Singing for Cups and Soggy Heads at Mory’s.” <em>Supercall</em>, 26 Sept. 2016, www.supercall.com/culture/the-strange-yale-university-tradition-of-drinking-cups-at-morys.</p>');

The front façade showcases a unique Queen Anne architectural style with one grand arch that is decomposed to three smaller arches—forming the building’s central entries. New Haven directories seem to imply that the interior has been renovated several times in the building’s lifetime, segmenting units to increase the number of tenants. Atop the brick façade is an entablature with an embellished architrave, floral designed frieze, a lined cornice. These design elements combined depict a welcoming, residential ambience in this New Haven historical neighborhood.&nbsp;</p>','<p>This three-story Queen Anne twin town-house is constructed of a brick exterior with a granite-cut foundation and a gable structured roof (1). The building’s street-facing facade demonstrates a Palladian style symmetry with two small arches that act as entrances to the double doorway. These two arches are structured to form a larger archway that bespeak an inviting aesthetic to this apartment complex. This larger archway provides for a second-floor bay where residents can step outside onto the street-facing balcony. The wooden, white painted pediment is stylized in such a manner that its vertices are aligned to the outer bases of the façade arches. In addition to this geometry, the pediment itself is ornamented with a red ivy design which surrounds an insignia of the building’s completed construction date—“1890”—at the center (1).&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The first story windows have cut stone stills and flat brick arches constructed above them. The second and third story windows also have the same cut stone stills but are topped with brick segmental arches—juxtaposing the brick-laid pattern of the building’s street-facing façade. </p><p><br></p><p>There are no clear signs of deterioration (2).&nbsp;</p>','<p>The twin-building is situated in the historic Italian neighborhood of Wooster Square. Wooster Street itself, between Olive Street and Chestnut Street, is formed of both residential and commercial buildings. These buildings include other apartment complexes as well as nationally recognized pizzerias such as Sally’s Apizza and Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana. The neighborhood includes two small parks, Wooster Memorial Playground which is located two lots westward of the building and the Paul Russo Memorial Park, as well as the eponymous Wooster Square Park. Small trees and green light posts line the cement and brick composed sidewalk. All in all, the street welcomes a family-oriented community that promotes traditional values which are reminded of by the brick and metal Wooster Square archway. Ornamented with a Cherry Blossom tree, the archway that over the intersection of Depalma Court and Wooster Street.</p>','<p>Constructed for Wooster Square resident Henry Farrell, the building has held its function as a residential building since its inception in 1890 (1). Wooster Square itself was formally considered a neighborhood in 1824 when the city of New Haven purchased the land for Wooster Square Park—named after the American Revolutionary War general, and Connecticut native, David Wooster (3). A majority of the housing development that occurred in the mid-19<sup>th </sup>century utilized Greek Revival, Italian Villa, Islamic Revival styles until architects began implementing Queen Anne and Second Empire styles towards the turn of the century (4). </p><p><br></p><p>Into the 20<sup>th</sup> century, the neighborhood became surrounded by industrial factories which opened the opportunity for Italian-America residents to migrate into the neighborhood. Some of these residents converted their homes into commercial storefronts. However, public disdain for Italian immigrants and Italian-American families acted as one factor that deprecated the value of the neighborhood into the mid 20<sup>th</sup> century. Families who were unable to make such storefront conversions tended to rely on the nearby industrial firms for economic sustainability. </p><p><br></p><p>This dependency in industry can be seen in a case study of Frank Scarpellino, a 197 Wooster Street resident from 1950 to 1970 (5). Mr. Scarpellino was listed as an employee of Sargent and Company (currently located in the Long Warf region) in a 1950 New Haven directory, but by 1970 the city directory acknowledged that his updated employment status was for a seafood restaurant named simply as the “Mariner Restaurant” (6). This change in employment status may indicate a fluctuation in the Wooster Square labor force from a large industry focus to a small-business, brick-and-mortar interest. The apartment complex, in general, would house predominately New Haven residents of Italian descent who occupied blue collar occupations such as chauffeurs, servicemen, and, again, positions at Sargent &amp; Company (5, 6, 7). </p><p><br></p><p>The City of New Haven would eventually recognize the Wooster Square neighborhood as a local historic district in 1970 (3).&nbsp;</p>','<p>Henry Farrell purchased an open lot from a Henry Bunnell in June of 1890.

Originally constructed for the Yale Law School at the end of the 19th century, Hendrie Hall has retained much of its original architecture from when it once housed aspiring lawyers and later various student groups and organizations (2). The result is a Janus-faced structure, presenting an imposing masonry facade on one end and a warm sandstone exterior at the other. Located along a historic section of Elm Street (3), the building now joins in the larger development of the Yale campus.</p>','<p><span style="color: black;">Entering from Elm Street one notices the impressive masonry facade, characteristic of the Italian Renaissance Revival style (4), divided into three distinct levels. At the ground, outlined stone surrounds one center archway entrance and another arched entrance to a small arcade. Two square windows sit on either side of the center archway. Moving upwards, the stone outlines become less evident and the center of the second floor features three large arched windows divided by columns, each subdivided into two smaller arches by additional columns. In front of each of these three sections lies a small balustrade. Finally, at the top of the structure the number of center windows increases to three sets of three, each set off by a small column, and the Historic Resources Inventory notes this “geometric pattern" (5). The building is topped with engraved brackets and a balustrade that runs the entire length of the structure. Meanwhile, the entrance from Parking Lot 51 features a brighter sandstone exterior. This time the distinction between the floors is less obvious, yet the exterior still features three levels of sharp, pointed square windows with the size and division of windows fairly consistent throughout. These two distinct exteriors are joined internally, although only somewhat, and one can quite literally see the convergence of the new and old at the center of the building where the brick wall shifts to white drywall (6).</span></p>','<p><span style="color: black;">From Elm Street, the building looks out on the New Haven Green. A popular bus stop on the corner of Temple Street and Elm Street sits across the street, yet foot traffic in front of the building is relatively quiet and large trees shade the sidewalk. Hendrie Hall is located between two private establishments, the Elihu Secret Society and the Graduate Club, and for this reason the building can feel slightly out of place given its imposing size and stately appearance (7). The Parking Lot 51 entrance sits among a collection of other Yale-affiliated buildings. As the architecture firm responsible for the new addition, KPMB notes that the newest face of Hendrie Hall was meant to join not just the surrounding cluster of buildings but Cross Campus as well (8). Despite the fact that this access point is set off from the street, the benches and pathways placed outside of this entrance present an inviting atmosphere.</span></p>','<p><span style="color: black;">At first Hendrie Hall provided an elegant new location for the Yale Law School, although as the Historic Resources Inventory notes the Sterling Law Building eventually superseded Hendrie Hall in 1935 (9). From that point forward, the building remained under Yale control and provided space for various student groups and offices for outside organizations as well. For example, during the 1930s the building appeared to house various social services groups in the city, such as the New Haven Council of Social Agencies (10). Towards the latter half of the 20th century, the building largely housed student organizations such as the Yale Banner, the Yale Glee Club, and the WYBC (11). The relatively quiet role that Hendrie Hall played on Yale’s campus was upended by the recent redesign of the location for the Yale School of Music. Now the building continues to house undergraduate organizations like the Yale Glee Club, along with practice spaces and offices for Yale School of Music students and faculty.</span></p>','<p><span style="color: black;">Originally constructed on the site of what was probably a wooden house, “Hendrie Hall was intended to be the first of several grand Yale buildings along Elm Street” according to the Historic Buildings of Connecticut website (12) (13) (14). Yet these buildings never materialized and the site on which Hendrie Hall was built and the surrounding block have remained attached to their early roots, at least until the recent renovations. The newest addition extends out into what was once open space behind a cluster of buildings and what was eventually converted into a parking lot (15) (16) (17). Since Hendrie Hall was first built, this cluster of buildings has seen a substantial amount of development, including the construction of a Yale Health Department building (18). In a broader sense, the Elm Street entrance has witnessed the development of downtown New Haven while the building and its neighbors have stayed true to their original design (19). On the other hand, the newest addition looks towards the Yale campus that it played a role in developing and updating.</span></p>');

The entrance of the church faces east on Dixwell Avenue and has a staircase leading up to the gable porch which contains four large beams supporting the roof that extends over the entrance. In between the beams, three large green and red crosses are suspended and behind these crosses rows of windows extend from the roof of the building to the top of the entrance doors which are also constructed of glass.

Today, the area has a very high building density, leaving very little room for green and trees, and is very much a commercial and residential environment. The street that the church is located on, Dixwell Avenue, additionally is a very important street in the town for shopping and also provides a route to Hamden, Connecticut which is located to the north of New Haven.</span></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The construction of this building all started with the Dixwell Area Redevelopment Plan of the 1960’s which wanted to diminish the parts of the town that had deteriorated and become&nbsp;damaged. Wanting to bring the community back together, they hoped that selling the land to private developers and building religious buildings, such as churches, as well as housing would bring the stability that the community needed in order to recover. The outcome of this project achieved the goal they had wanted and resulted in giving the people of the town a place to come together for religious services as well as other events. Since its construction in the 1980, the building has been owned and used by the United House of Prayer for All People. </span></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Before the construction of the United House of Prayer for All People, evidence suggests that this plot of land on Dixwell Avenue was divided and up and composed of multiple residential homes.

This $1.1 million church was inspired by a modernist, California style and faces east on a very popular shopping street of Dixwell Ave. It is very easy to spot the United House for All People by its very large 3 red and green crosses which are suspended above its porch at its entrance. Since its construction, the church has served as a place that united the people of the town and today is part of a regional church that has 130 congregations. </span></p>');

It stands right on the edge of Yale\'s net-gothic campus, close enough to make it a quick travel to the center of the campus but far enough to where there is not a steady stream of students traveling by.

It shares one substantial lot with the corresponding University Tower; surrounded by Park, George, Crown, and York Streets. All 198 feet, housing of sixteen stories, can be observed upon from all angles due to its sweeping surroundings within close proximity that consist of a green space and parking lots complimented with a gated pool for those who occupy the tower\'s housing.

As a part of the Oak Street Development Project in the 1950\'s, the particular lot that these towers equip is surrounded by a large, densely populated area of commercial, restaurants, residential and educational use that is right on the edge of the Dwight neighborhood and at the beginning of downtown New Haven. Sitting on the Oak Street Connector that divides the Yale Medical facilities from Yale University\'s primary campus, allowing it to serve as a fantastic location for any and all students looking for affordable housing that is "off campus."</p>','<p>In 1958, the city of New Haven used eminent domain when it became the owner of the residential lot that was home to the University Towers. In 1961, New Haven gave all the rights to University Towers, Inc.

This gives reason for its large concentration of undergraduate students along with some graduate students or New Haven citizens that fall into the attraction of the building. The University Tower compliments this living situation well by attracting a higher concentration of elderly citizens along with some graduate students who are more willing and capable to pay extra expenses for a different location with very similar amenities plus a few additional perks. Residential use has always been its primary, but it has also consistently had medical offices on the first floor of the building, even to this day. </p>','<p>Prior to the lot being redeveloped into two towers under the Oak Street Development Project, the Sunburn Maps can be observed to see it had a high concentration of multi-story, single family homes along with a Episcopalian Church and the Webster Public School.

In 1961, New Haven gave all the rights to University Towers, Inc.

University Towers Section B, Inc. has the current claim on what has been a profitable investment for them, rarely ever having a vacancy rate deviate more than 6-7% from 100%. With the growth of the area that corresponded to the increasing density of people near Yale\'s campus and its location being right on the edge of downtown New Haven, the development project found it equitable and efficient to redevelop the lot into two, profound towers that would go on to serve as wonderful investments of land and capital.</p>');

As a result, the Connecticut Mental Health Center was completed in 1966, replacing the residential homes that existed on the land prior.  The building fits in with the surrounding medical facilities, most of which also carry similar modernist architectural elements such as reinforced concrete, brick, rectangular/cubic shapes, and large windows.  It was built to not only extend the increasing number of medical facilities in the area, but also to offer mental health and addiction services to the underinsured/uninsured members of the greater New Haven community. (3)</span></p>','<p><span style="color: black;">The aftermath of World War I and II heavily impacted New Haven in a negative light.&nbsp;The city, specifically Oak Street, struggled to overcome obstacles such as its increasing traffic on residential streets, decripit neighborhoods, and poor public health.&nbsp;Oak Street separates the downtown neighborhood district from the Hill neighborhood. Much of the traffic that occurred on Oak Street was a result of people commuting from New York to Boston or other areas of the greater New England area. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: black;">In 1953, Richard Lee was elected mayor.&nbsp;He set out to rebuild New Haven by creating safer residential areas, introducing new city parks, solving the traffic issues, and encouraging research and educational groups to develop in the city. In addition to this he wanted to provide needed services that would create a safer, more unified and dignified community that could overcome health, educational, racial, and socioeconomic disparities. (4)</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: black;">Rumors of urban renewal began circulating in many declining American cities.&nbsp;In response, the federal government implemented numerous acts in hopes of getting these cities back on their feet. These acts, namely the Federal Housing Act (1949), the Federal Aid Highway Act (1956), and the Community Mental Health Act (1663) had a direct impact on 34 Park Street and the surrounding area, enabling Mayor Richard Lee to put his plans in action.&nbsp;The Oak Street Connector project, the first urban renewal project in New Haven, had a direct influence on the soon come construction of the CMHC.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: black;">Despite the intentions of the Oak Street demolition project’s efforts to create more space for a highway connector that would conquer the traffic problem and community health centers to improve public health, the residents of the Hill had little opportunity to voice their opinions.&nbsp;As a result, Oak Street, transformed from a slum to a dense commercial area, displacing over 800 homes and 300 local businesses (4), including the home of Floyd M Kregnow and Jean Petrillo, who lived at 34 Park Street, which is now the address of the CMHC.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: black;">New Haven used federal funds to dramatically alter its landscape. Of the funds received, $4,900,000 was granted to the construction of a mental health center that would collaborate with Yale’s Department of Psychiatry in order to not only provide excellent mental health services to uninsured or underinsured members of the greater New Haven community, but also to encourage research.&nbsp; (2)</span></p>','<p><span style="color: black;">Prior to the 1966 construction of the Connecticut Mental Health Center that stands today in the Hill Neighborhood, was a home belonging to Floyd M Kregnow and Jean Petrillo. In 1955, homes surrounding Oak Street were bulldozed and cleared to make way for a connection to the highway and commercial construction.&nbsp;In 1963 architects, Perdersen and Tilney, made up plans for a mental health center. The building was completed in 1966 and was directly made possible by John F. Kennedy’s Community Mental Health Act of 1963, which sought to bring these mental health services to communities rather than at the larger scale state facilities.&nbsp;The project was heavily subsidized by the State of Connecticut.&nbsp;Other medical affiliated buildings surround the property, which heavily contrasts from the prior immigrant neighborhood slum. In 1992, the building was expanded by Landmark architects to accommodate for the increasing research program and needed office space.&nbsp;</span></p>');

In line with the instantly recognizable Apple Store aesthetic, white limestone sparkles in the sunlight and frames the wall of glass that faces Broadway and casts light into the modernist interior. Hanging in the center of the glass wall is the luminous ‘Apple’ logo, simultaneously signaling the stores brand and marking out the store’s glassy double-door entrance. Turning into the side lane between the Yale Bookshop and the Apple Store, visitors find the 14 residential college crests lining the white stone exterior wall of the building — a concrete symbol of Yale’s ownership. No part of the original 1915 structure has stood the test of time, with this most recent rendition of 65 Broadway being as new as 2011.[iii] The highly rectilinear white structure stands out amid the bricks and stones that characterize Broadway as a testament to Apple Inc.’s innovation and creativity.</span></p>','<p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(52, 52, 52);">The Broadway we have today is unrecognizable from the one that existed even just a mere 20 years ago. In the late 1990s, Yale University bought up the triangular block and transformed it into the upscale student-centered shopping area it is today. The small block that makes up the Broadway neighborhood is one that represents — albeit in retrospect — many of the architectural styles that governed the 20th century.[iv] From Italianate, to Queen Anne, to Collegiate Gothic and Modernist, Broadway today is a microcosm of architectural pursuit.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(52, 52, 52);">Broadway today is classified by its welcoming atmosphere: wide pedestrian sidewalks, bright storefronts, evenly spaced trees, and the distinctly recognizable red brick that establishes a rhythm and balance between the buildings despite their varying architectural styles. The diversity of the stores, from clothing to books to cosmetics and multiple genres of food, the urban setting is not only catered towards Yale students but is welcoming to the whole of the New Haven community.</span></p>','<p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: black;">The designated consumer space of 65 Broadway came to life with the deconstruction of the initially constructed residential houses. Since then, while the store area has changed hands, transforming from a barber shop, to a grocery store, to a restaurant, and now to the Apple store, it has always been one of the undeniably integral veins at the heart of the Broadway district. Currently, 65 Broadway is home to both the New Haven Apple Store (facing Broadway and the parking lot in the middle), and the vacant back lot of roughly the same size. </span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: black;">As with the rest of Broadway, number 65 has a deep past of being home to a local family business. It’s recent commercialization into the space for a national chain pushes back on this rich history of serving the New Haven community. 65 Broadway stands as a microcosm of shifting societal values, with its changing ownership symbolizing society’s turn away from the family unit to commercially centered spaces.[ix]</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: black;">The address began its journey as a store in approximately 1913 as a barber shop that, two years later, shared its space with a realtor’s office. The current division of the retail space is reminiscent of the split of ownership at its founding. Subsequently, a locally run grocery store, Quality Grocery, began its 40-year reign at number 65 before expanding and moving closer to the York Street intersection. In the mid-80s, the space was geared towards the local restaurant and food service industry, with pizza place La Piazza, finding its home at 65 for a few years.[x] During this time number 65 was also bought up by Yale and merged with 67 and 69 to establish the Yale Co-op East.[xi] The current structure, a $4.8 million Apple Store, opened on September 24, 2011.[xii]</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p><span style="color: black;">Until Yale began its revolution of Broadway in the 1990s, remnants of the original building from 1915 were incorporated into the ever-developing modern structure. Even the expansion of the Yale Co-op in 1974 to take up 65-69 Broadway included elements of the original fireproof bank from 1915, and the western wall and elevated office space of the previous building. The post-modern building of the 1980s was designed in conjunction with Yale’s new (at the time) colleges, Morse and Ezra Stiles, and the preservation of past building material clearly emphasized the importance of the grand arc of history in the development of Broadway.[xiii] However, the Apple Store’s establishment wiped away these narrative elements, and symbolizes Yale’s efforts modernize and clean up Broadway.</span></p>','<p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: black;">As one of the first roads extending off New Haven’s original nine-square design, Broadway holds almost unparalleled significance in the social history of the city.</span><a href="#_edn1" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[i]</a><span style="color: black;"> At the turn of the 19th century, the street was born as a residential offshoot of the grid designed to create more housing for New Haven’s growing population and connect New Haven to settlements in the north.[xiv</span><a href="#_edn2" target="_blank" style="color: black;">]</a><span style="color: black;"> It was here in approximately 1812 that the town hay scales and public well found their home at the base of the Broadway center block, making it a mercantile center. At its inception, Broadway was a very significant place: it broke the rhythm of the old colonial town that stopped at the corner of York Street and Elm Street and granted access to the farms in the greater New Haven area.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: black;">In around the 1830s and 40s, Broadway began its change from a residential street to an increasingly consumer oriented area with the establishment of firstly a school and a hotel. The late 19</span><sup style="color: black;">th</sup><span style="color: black;"> century brought the streetcar to Broadway. At the turn of the 20th century, it began to develop as a little shopping area on the outskirts of the nine square town — accessible to all by the streetcar that ran through it.[xv]</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: black;">As Broadway’s pulsing beat runs pushes through the decades, it only grew in significance when Yale established its plans to purchase Broadway in 1992.[xvi] As architect and professor Vincent Scully said, “When Payne Whitney Gym was built behind Broadway, the street became an important thoroughfare for its students.”[xvii] However, this change in ownership also resulted in Broadway\'s transition from a chaotic, colorful street defined by its family-run businesses to a cleaner and more commercialized version of itself. </span><a href="#_edn6" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[</a>xviii]<span style="color: black;"> The then Yale Vice President Bruce Alexander noted</span><a href="#_edn7" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[vii]</a><span style="color: black;"> the developments as a necessary element in the university’s urban renewal aim to invest in and tidy up the area around the school. In his view, cleansing Broadway and replacing the family stores with national chains created a better environment for the students. </span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: black;">Broadway’s redevelopment by Yale in the 1990s and early 2000s revolutionized the district and played into the broader upscaling of New Haven. This symbolized Yale’s realization that the fate of it and New Haven are irreconcilably intertwined – a crime ridden and dirty city would only cause people to turn their noses on the university. Some community members saw this redevelopment as Yale’s authoritarian destruction of Broadway – seeing it as the death of the old city. While the district, and New Haven in general, have lost the unique character it once had, it has also ceased to be the blighted block of the 80s.[xvi] Broadway’s remodeling was pioneered by Yale architecture professor Herbert Newman and Department of Traffic and Parking official Leonard Liss. Their efforts not only focused on the upscaling of buildings and shops, but, with the planting of elm trees and the creation of a park, on the beautification of the urban landscapes.</span><a href="#_edn9" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[</a>xvii]</p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p><span style="color: black;">Broadway’s </span><em style="color: black;">ad hoc</em><span style="color: black;"> development has stood as a signal of the changing times. The district itself reflects the shifting social values witnessed by America in only a hundred years. From farming, to family businesses to commercial retail, Broadway has seen it all.</span></p>');

Stevens and City of New Haven','43,792 sqft','<p><strong style="color: rgb(45, 59, 69);"><em>Background</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(45, 59, 69);">To understand the current building, we have to go back to 1954, 10 years before it was built, when Richard C. Lee was first elected mayor having run on a campaign that promised to revive the stagnating city through massive redevelopment. By then, new haven was suffering from a diminishing tax base, increased crime, and gross ethnic and racial divisions. The city had gone from 80% of the local population living in the dense urban area in the 1920s to just 50% in the 1960s and had seen a 41% increase in crime from 1950-1960 due to the consolidation of industry and disappearance of urban based manufacturing as well as the rapid flight to suburbia as highways and private automobiles gained prominence. </span><strong style="color: rgb(45, 59, 69);">[1]</strong><span style="color: rgb(45, 59, 69);"> By clearing slums, developing highway connectors and incentivizing commercial development in the central business district, Lee sought to eradicate urban blight. </span></p><p><br></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(45, 59, 69);"><em>Initial Project</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(45, 59, 69);">Having already begun work on the Oak street connector to bring suburban traffic into New Haven, Lee turned to his next project, the Church St. redevelopment and renewal plan which became known as the Chapel Square Mall. </span><strong style="color: rgb(45, 59, 69);">[2] </strong><span style="color: rgb(45, 59, 69);">The project was initially meant to be a simple redevelopment of the vacant Gamble Desmond building alongside the mall, but Lee hoped to make a splash and turned to prominent developer and Broadway producer Roger L. Stevens for help in 1955. Stevens, who had become famous for buying and selling the Empire State in just 24 hours and securing a $2M profit, was uninspired by the small project and wrote to Lee: “You know, the problem with our deal is it doesn’t go far enough. We should expand our thinking to include the full width of the Green and include four more blocks.” </span><strong style="color: rgb(45, 59, 69);">[3]</strong></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(45, 59, 69);">Tempted by the potential of an even larger project, Lee agreed to clear the city blocks through eminent domain and condemnation, after which Stevens would buy the site for $4,303,821 and pump $25M of development into the construction of a hotel, office tower, department store and retail complex which would be designed by New York City architect Lathrop Douglass. A parking structure known as the Temple Street Garage would be designed by Paul Rudolph and payed for by the New Haven Parking Authority. The deal was signed by both parties in 1958 and by 1959 the city had begun forcing businesses out of their buildings. By 1960 the majority of the site had been cleared (see site history and images – the Tuttle Morehouse and Taylor building which originally occupied this site was one of the last to go). Malley’s a local department store agreed to move into a dedicated building in the future complex, and Sheraton began negotiating for rights to build the 350-room Park Plaza hotel. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(45, 59, 69);">Due to the non-traditional plan and the forced clearing of 4 blocks in the center of downtown, development moved slowly and Stevens began bleeding money. Turning to Yale for help in 1962, Stevens received a $4.5M loan and an introduction to Macy’s executives who agreed to move into the second department store building, which opened in 1964. By then, Stevens had grown tired of the politics involved and handed off development of the hotel to the Gilbane Building Company and office/retail to the Fusco-Amatruda Construction Company, which completed the project in 1967. </span><strong style="color: rgb(45, 59, 69);">[2]</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(45, 59, 69);"><em>Failure</em></strong><span style="color: rgb(45, 59, 69);"> </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(45, 59, 69);">Despite initial success as a shopping center, the Chapel Square Mall was developed in a tumultuous time for the city’s retail environment. Between 1960 and 1973 3.3 M square feet of retail opened in seven shopping centers around New Haven and by 1982 Malley’s shut down after 129 years in business </span><strong style="color: rgb(45, 59, 69);">[1]</strong><span style="color: rgb(45, 59, 69);">. In 1984 as the city was about to acquire control of the project the Rouse Company, a Maryland based mall developer expressed interest, purchased the retail structure and pumped $14M into its redevelopment, including a new picnic-style food court and new, high-end tenants. </span><strong style="color: rgb(45, 59, 69);">[4] </strong><span style="color: rgb(45, 59, 69);">Between 1987 and 1997, New Haven retail saw another 29% decline and key tenants such as Macy’s and Cornan’s furniture moved out (in 1993 and 1994, respectively), forcing the Rouse Company to relinquish control of the retail property to the Greater New Haven Chamber of Commerce in May of 1995. </span><strong style="color: rgb(45, 59, 69);">[2, 5] </strong></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(45, 59, 69);">A year earlier, the Cordish Company, a Baltimore based developer bought the Park Plaza hotel, which had gone bankrupt – utilizing a $10M state grant and pumping in an additional $10M themselves to redevelop the property as the Omni hotel. </span><strong style="color: rgb(45, 59, 69);">[6]</strong><span style="color: rgb(45, 59, 69);"> When Rouse left the retail center, Cordish received option rights to entire compound, but those rights were illegally reneged by the Chamber of Commerce, leading to a large lawsuit. In 2002, the Chamber of Commerce sold the retail property to Williams Jackson Ewing Inc. and Lubert-Adler Partners for $2.6M and $900k in debts owed. The two firms converted the mall into a 75-unit residence court and leased out ground floor retail to various shops such as including Ann Taylor Loft, Cold Stone Creamery, Quizno\'s and Rite Aid. </span><strong style="color: rgb(45, 59, 69);">[7]</strong><span style="color: rgb(45, 59, 69);"> The two department stores were knocked down in 2010 for the $140M development of the Gateway Community College Campus which opened in 2012. 181 Crown is technically part of the larger Chapel Square Mall, but is still owned by the Cordish Company since it was once attached to the hotel. In recent year, this retail outpost, consisting of just two storefronts has been rented out to Barteca Restaurant Group, who operate the Barcelona Wine Bar, and The Wine Thief, which both moved in in 2007.</span></p>','<p>Not set on any of the original streets in the nine-square plan, this site would have been a small area within larger plats of land until Temple St. and Crown St. were developed. Crown St. was already present from State street to Church St. in the 1775 Stiles Map of the city, but was only extended to Hubbard St. (now York) and past this site in 1802. Similarly, Temple St. was originally laid out in 1784, but did not appear in any city directory until 1840. <strong>[8]</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Sometime around 1812, Joel Walter who graduated from Yale in 1800 and was involved in the printing and publishing trade erected a 2-story frame building and lived in it until around 1840 (date is unknown since these streets weren’t included in city directories). By 1841, the house had been purchased by Amasa Porter, a church deacon, who lived in the structure until he died in 1856, whereupon it was inherited by his son, Amasa G. Porter, an attorney, who lived there until his death in 1872. <strong>[9]</strong> </p><p>In 1894 Horace W. Porter sold the home to George H. Tuttle and Cornelius S. Morehouse, two of the three principals at Tuttle, Morehouse &amp; Taylor (TM&amp;T), a local printing and publishing firm that was looking for space to expand their operations. TM&amp;T promptly demolished the home and erected a five story Romanesque Revival building that combined two previous lots 123 and 125 Temple Street and featured floor level retail.<strong> </strong>By 1909 the rapid growth and expanding product lines caused TM&amp;T to take over all of the first floor retail including a third address at 179 Crown Street. In 1911, the company purchased the land from the heirs of Morehouse and Tuttle. <strong>[10] </strong>The TM&amp;T building stayed under company ownership until January 1946 when it was sold for $80,000 to Realty Inc. a firm owned by Bernard Kepkind Henry Sugarman and George Horwitz and the company relinquished control of the ground level retail. In October of the same year, the firm itself was acquired by the Plug, Strassler, and Weissman Investment Group which liquidated all assets six months later. The entire bottom floor of the building was rented to the Music Corner Record Shop from 1947 until the building was demolished on January 21<sup>st</sup>, 1960 to make way for the Chapel Square Mall. <strong>[9, 11, 12]&nbsp;</strong></p>','<p>Hosting both Barcelona Wine Bar, a popular tapas style restaurant and The Wine Thief, a boutique liquor and wine shop, 181 Crown St. is strongly associated with the hustle and bustle of night-time entertainment, despite the menacing quality of Paul Rudolph’s brutalist style Temple Street Parking Lot after sunset. New developments in 2017 like Brother Jimmy’s BBQ, a new eatery and bar with heavy traffic on Thursday evenings caddy corner to the building, Olives and Oil, an Italian restaurant and frequent Greek-life formal venue directly as well as the massive Vanity Restaurant and Venue, a nightclub frequented by up and coming DJs across Temple Street, are quickly establishing this intersection as the center of New Haven nightlife. Other nearby attractions are Stella Blues and Cask Republic, both bars as well as Mecha Noodle, a 2016 ramen restaurant. During the day, the restaurants see some traffic, but most public movement takes place a block north along Chapel St.&nbsp;</p>','<p>181 Crown is part of the larger Chapel Square Mall, a block-encompassing 2-story tall concrete and brick façade in modern minimalist style. While the Chapel and Church sides of the building interact with and invite in the public realm by recessing the ground floors to develop covered walkways, the Temple and Crown sides are mostly flat against the sidewalk, with only minimal depth changes at reinforced concrete piers and glazing, which composes the entire ground floor. The second floor is separated by a horizontal concrete beam has no glazing and includes a continuation of the structural piers separated by dark Ironspot roman bricks (similar to those used by Frank Lloyd Wright). The building is topped by a horizontal protruding concrete cornice with a series of lights for wall illumination. The two tenants have fairly idiosyncratic entrances, Barcelona opting for a Corten steel sideway and heavy vertically slatted wood door and The Wine Thief employing a comical backlit sign surrounded by a metal cornice with a series of solid gridded arches and a lilac door.&nbsp;</p>','<p><strong>[1]</strong> Rae, Douglas W.&nbsp;<em>City: Urbanism and Its End.</em>&nbsp;Yale University Press, 2008.</p><p><strong>[2]</strong> Lewis, Dain. <em>The Developers Game: The Private Sector and the Church Street Project, 1955-1964</em>.

The 2 ½ floor symmetrical house features paired end-chimneys, four magnificent white columns and an iron staircase that leads up to the first-floor portico. In addition to being labeled an architectural gem, the Timothy Bishop House is a historical emblem of Yale in the New Haven community.

Hartford: Connecticut Historical Commission, January 19, 1981.</p>','Dr. Timothy Bishop','<p>The Timothy Bishop House is a phenomenal example of the Federal-style architecture that dominated the early 19th century. The house is a basic square shape, 2 ½ stories high and two rooms deep. The house is complemented by a portico with ionic capitals atop four white columns. At the far ends of the building are pilasters surmounted by ionic capitals identical to those on the columns. A pediment rests above the column structures. In the center of the pediment is a semi-elliptical window (fanlight), which displays the geometrical décor common to Federal buildings. On the second floor is a detailed center bay with miniature pilasters and elaborate molding. The gable roof lies parallel to the street, slanting downwards and allowing for a pristine view of the symmetrical rooftop chimneys. The front of the building is decorated with large windows that seem to be barred with a decorative wrought iron guard. The front wooden door has an elliptical window overhead and two sidelight panels on either end. The dark coloring of the door offers extreme contrast to the neutral colored clapboard. In 1910 the building was renovated to include an elevated basement with two large storefront windows and an iron staircase leading up to the main entrance. The top floor was also remodeled in the 1930s to resemble the ballroom of its neighbor, the John Cook House. Extending from the northwest wing of the building is a two-level brick building that was also constructed during this renovation. It has a flat gable roof and a very homogenous body in terms of texture and color. There are multiple regular size windows along the length of the building. Along the sides of the building are multiple iron staircases allowing entry to different office buildings. There is also a blue tent reading “Timothy Bishop House” that hangs overhead a first-floor entrance. None of these side entrances are visible from the street. At first glance, its architecture doesn’t appear to coincide with the Federal style of the main building.&nbsp;</p>','<p>Prior to construction of the Timothy Bishop House, 32 Elm Street was an empty plot of land.&nbsp;According to a 1748 Plan for the Town of New Haven, the site had been granted to Rev. John Davenport and was being used as a private garden. Some sources have suggested that Davenport’s lot was strategically positioned as to facilitate access to the central marketplace (the present-day New Haven Town Green) and the harbor. Establishing a colony in 18th century New Haven, Davenport’s colonial prominence relays important information about the site’s political authority and its prestige within the broader city landscape. Indeed, it appears as though this historical prestige may have transcended time. In 1815 the lot was purchased by Timothy Bishop, graduate of Yale Medical School, Secretary of the New Haven Hospital and member of the New Haven Colony Historical Society. The historical and cultural importance of this site, might explain why it is one of the few early 19th century homes remaining in the area.&nbsp;</p>','<p>The building is located on the south side of Elm Street, one block east of Orange Street and one block west of State Street central thoroughfare. Today, the block lies within the heart of New Haven’s civic centers and commercial activities - walking distance from the City Hall, public library, multiple banks and the News 8 WTNH headquarters. The Timothy Bishop house is enclosed by parking lots on its right and in its rear. Directly across the street are two more historic Federal buildings, currently occupied by law offices. Farther down Elm Street in both directions are various restaurants, office buildings, and small retail stores. On any given day, there is a heavy flow of traffic, most likely heading towards I-91 and I-95 interstate highways. Especially during business hours, pedestrian activity seems to be concentrated along Orange Street.&nbsp;</p>','<ul><li>1816 - 1873: Residence for the family of Dr. Timothy Bishop, Secretary of the New Haven Hospital and member of the New Haven Colony Historical Society.</li><li>1873 – 1910: Residence of Edward M. McCabe, M.D. During this time, the house address was 22 Elm Street. </li><li>1910 - 1945: Charles P. Thompson acquired the house. He opened an antique shop in the basement and oversaw a majority of the interior and exterior alterations to the building. During this time, it became known as the Thompson Shop.</li><li>Circa 1980: Windsor Realty Co. leased the building as commercial office space</li></ul>','<p>One of the most interesting aspects of the Timothy Bishop House is its ability to elude renewal and development practices that have transformed the surrounding area. Many researchers have acknowledged the remarkable and notably rare preservation of this historic building. When the Timothy Bishop House was constructed in 1816, this area of town had been characterized as a “fashionable residential neighborhood.” Then, as large expanses of land opened in the northern and western quarters of town, many wealthy landowners chose to relocate their residences. Concurrent with this exodus, redevelopment projects of the early 20<sup>th</sup> century transformed the area it into a commercial district. Following WWII and peaking in the mid-1950s was another surge of redevelopment projects. Attempts at urban renewal effectively replaced older structures with more modern structures.Somehow the Timothy Bishop House managed to escape encroaching renewal and was formally recognized as a New Haven Landmark by the New Haven Preservation Trust. </p><p><br></p><p>There is ample reason to believe that the building’s structural resilience is tied to the social and cultural authority of its origins. Before being purchased by the Bishop family, the site was originally land owned by Rev. John Davenport.Both Davenport and Bishop had significant affiliations to the civic and educational institutions embedded within New Haven. These institutions are emblems of immense social capital, even today. Despite decades of redevelopment and land transformations, the Timothy Bishop House has remained practically unchanged. Aside from minimal structural adjustments and interior redesigning, the building closely resembles its original construction. Efforts to preserve the buildings physical form, most likely required funding and resource allocation by the city of New Haven and the New Haven Preservation Trust. Hence, one might infer that the Bishop House possesses significant value beyond the scope of architectural artistry. </p><p><br></p><p>One could also argue that the social function had changed slightly during the transition from residential to commercial usage. However, it is interesting to note the enduring symbolic representation. Some distinguishing characteristics, including the New Haven Landmark plaque, hanging directory sign and barbed wire fencing emphasize the building’s historical sanctity and eminence and offer stark comparison to nearby buildings. Additionally, the Timothy Bishop House is composed of law offices and doctor’s offices. These things lead me to believe that the Timothy Bishop House still functions as a representation of the power and wealth associated with civic engagement and higher education. </p><p><br></p>','Farmers Insurance, Gordon Weiss, M.D., Robert S.

Mr. Lichter claims that he sent around a petition to his employees to get the union to stop picketing. It seems that the conversations between Mr. Lichter, and his employees where all civilized and fair; his employees voted on whether or not they wanted to join a union, and Mr. Lichter listened to and agreed to discuss their requests about having shorter working days, more regular hours, and certain working conditions with his lawyer. The union construed this as an attempt to convince and prevent employees from joining the union. The union picketed and held a strike which two of five employees joined, although one later left for economic reasons. Mr. Lichter then granted insurance and other benefits, which were likely timed to act as inducements and keep the employees from joining a union, and is in fact considered to be unfair labor practices.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">	The Connecticut Board of Labor Relations determined that the last striking employee should be reinstated, and that the oral vote on the topic of unionizing is not enough to make the decision; the vote must take place by secret ballot. The employer was ordered to stop interfering with labor union efforts to reach out to employees and to abstain from changing work benefits and conditions while employees are actively interacting with unions with the intent of joining. This is a brief summary of what happened—you can read the full report here (In the Matter Of Lichter’s Inc.).</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">	Based on the permits issued, it seems like Nathan Lichter owned the building for a period, and between 1962 and 1964 the structure was purchased by C.A. White. After this point, Lichter\'s Inc. Cleaners and every subsequent business leased the space rather than purchasing it outright (New Haven Building Department 1). It is unclear what building the owners and occupants referenced in the earlier permits refer to; this building was built around 1940 and the plot of land now ascribed to 65 Howe Street was split between buildings that no longer exist. Joseph Taylor\'s photos of the Chapel West District circa 1900 were taken from the Chapel West website, and can be found below for an idea of what the area used to look like (History, images 15-17).</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">	 In 1986, C.A. White converted the building from a dry cleaning facility to a restaurant. India Palace had non-bearing partitions erected to divvy up various spaces as kitchens and storage, and a dropped ceiling was installed. During India Palace\'s occupancy, the building was re-roofed once in 2005. After a fire in 2014, India Palace moved out. The fire damaged the built-up roof at the rear of the building, and water damaged the roof in two additional places, with the cost of replacing and repairing different sections of the roof totaling $40,000 (New Haven Building Department 6). India Palace moved two buildings down Howe Street and now occupies the diner-style building, with the restaurant now called Tandoor.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">	In 2015, C.A. White began renovations to the India Palace\'s full basement, kitchen, storage, restrooms and dining room in preparation for House of Naan moving in (New Haven Building Department 7). The interior finishings of India Palace were all demolished (New Haven Building Department 7). C.A. White also commissioned repairs to water-damaged areas of the roof and re-roofed the entirety of the fire-damaged area (New Haven Building Department 5, 6). In order to meet Connecticut code, the building needed to provide an easement (providing an easement means that a property owner gives another property owner the right to trespass on their land) (New Haven Building Department 8).</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> 	In the case of House of Naan, their building needed to have another door added to the side of the restaurant facing Rudy\'s in order to comply with CT code, chapter 10 (providing a means of egress). Interestingly, C.A White, the purchaser of the 65 Howe, owned and still owns Rudy\'s Bar &amp; Grill next door, which made the process of preparing a mutual property easement smoother (C.A. White). In fact, C.A. White owns several buildings on Howe and Chapel that are currently occupied by restaurants, small retail stores, and medical and office spaces (C.A. White). </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">	House of Naan is more upscale and hip than India Palace (a quick side-by-side look at the building fronts will convince you of this), and fits in with the feel of the area. The surrounding restaurants are similarly more expensive, trendy, and some fit a certain niche (i.e., Miya\'s sustainable sushi restaurant). The area has transitioned from the mostly industrial and manufacturing businesses in late 1800s and early 1900s to a partially-commercial,&nbsp;partially-residential area known for its restaurants, bars, and night life.</span></p><p><br></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">	The building was built circa 1940 (Connecticut Historical Commission). In 1888 the plot for 65 Howe Street did not exist. The land was split between 67 Howe and two buildings on the corner of Howe and Chapel. In 1911 the plot of 65 Howe was owned by E.B. Watts (Sanborn Co., 1911). The plot itself was smaller than the current one, holding a small building that was squeezed in between 75 Howe and the two buildings that shared the corner plot of Howe and Chapel. In 1923, the building gained a larger plot when a section of buildings on the corner of Howe and Chapel were demolished and replaced with businesses working with steel (New Haven Building Department 13) and wood and metal (New Haven Building Department 13) 65 Howe Street was first occupied by Lichter\'s Inc. Cleaners, a Cleaning and Dyeing business. </span></p><p><br></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">C.A. White. 2018. “Commercial Real Estate.” CA White.

This is likely an original feature of the building from its construction in 1880, when the containing room was a library in the home of Arthur Twining Hadley, a professor and later the 13<sup>th</sup> president of Yale. Built in 1880 when Hadley was conducting a tutorship at Yale, the home remained the Hadleys\' residence until 1939, when Hadley\'s wife, Helen, passed away. The brick home saw the couple’s marriage; the birth of their three children, Morris, Hamilton, and Laura; Hadley’s mother’s death; Hadley\'s appointment to president in 1899, and Hadley’s own death in 1930 (9)(3). The area around 93 Whitney was a fashionable neighborhood for influential New Haven residents when he purchased the lot for $6,000 in 1880. Over the next year, Hadley built his home in consultation with a local architect for another $14,000 (10). One block from Hillhouse Ave., a traditionally wealthy enclave in New Haven, the lots on Whitney were smaller than those on Hillhouse in 1911. Still, photos from that era show neighboring homes of similar stature, and those homes on Hillhouse seem to be of similar dimension. Hadley’s neighbors along Whitney, Trumbull, and Hillhouse bear names familiar to Yalies now, including Chittenden, Farnam, and Phelps (11).</p><p><br></p><p>Many of these buildings, like 93 Whitney, were made of brick due to the city’s fire laws, a fact that Hadley complained about in an 1880 diary entry due to the material’s high cost relative to wood. Still, despite these constraints, Hadley built an impressive home, first for himself and his mother, to be joined later by his wife after their marriage in 1891(12) .The original floorplan of the house reflects Hadley’s aspirations to raise a family and entertain guests. The first floor contained a parlor, living room, dining room, and kitchen fit for entertaining, while the second and third floors had five bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a study (see multimedia gallery for approximate floor plan). The house also had a cellar for the laundry room, where the Caseus cheese shop now stands, and an attic for storage. This floor plan is typical of many family homes built in this period, with its central hall on the first floor surrounded by more public areas and more private quarters upstairs. Writing in 1948, Morris Hadley remembers the house fondly, stating that though it was “architecturally terrible, it was a delightful house for the children who grew up there…with its many nooks and corners, and above all with its enormous attic under the sloping roof, an attic fifty feet long and twenty feet high, lighted by little windows that looked out over the roofs and tree tops of the city (13).</p><p><br></p><p>What began as a quiet, unpaved street in 1880, quickly became busier over the next half century with the advent of streetcars and automobiles (13). These changes are partly reflected in the 1911 New Haven Atlas, which shows several industrial sites just south of the home on Whitney and Audobon (11). The sleepy neighborhood grew so well trafficked that Morris Hadley recounts one visitor remarking that “if the Hadley family had any commercial sense they would tear down this house and put up a filling station (13).” Of course, similar changes were occurring around the city as it grew throughout the early 20<sup>th</sup> century.</p><p><br></p><p>After Helen Hadley’s death in 1939, the building was sold to Kusterer Bros., which quickly rented the space to Hawley W. Lincoln Undertakers, a funeral home. Over the latter half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, the building was altered to accommodate multiple commercial spaces, hinting at the changing character of the Whitney-Audobon neighborhood into one dominated by shops and restaurants and the Hillhouse Ave. neighborhood into a college campus (15). A number of different business occupied the building over the next 70 years, including a dry cleaner, clothing stores, bakeries, and restaurants. From the 1980 city directory onwards, there was always at least one restaurant and one retail shop, reflecting the steady demand for these types of businesses throughout the past 40 years. In 1970, the city directories begin showing multiple individual tenants in the Arthur Twining Hadley home, suggesting that the upper stories had been converted into apartment units (5)(6)(7)(8). It is unclear what types of individuals rented these apartments, though given the proximity to Yale’s campus, it’s likely that many of the renters were graduate students or other Yale-affiliated individuals. These apartments remain available for rent today.</p><p><br></p><p>As tenants moved in and out, they likely made alterations to the old building. When interviewed, one current owner of Fashionista Vintage &amp; Variety lamented many of these changes. Before opening Fashionista, they undid many of the realtors’ renovations, including the suspended ceiling, the drab grey carpeting, and the drywall hiding the three original fireplaces, located in what were originally the library, parlor, and dining room of the home. Underneath, they discovered features like the Old Wood fireplace that hinted at the building’s past as a stately home. Walking through the shop and the upstairs apartment, one feels disoriented by these reminders of the building’s past as they contrast with the florescent lights and other modern fixtures. The spaces feel anchored in the present, with the trendy Caseus restaurant and cheese shop, the sleek salon, and the quirky vintage shop. However, the legacy of the building’s history remains in the details that remind observers of the “delightful house” Morris Hadley remembers in his writings.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>','<p>The Arthur Twining Hadley house is a brick, three story Queen Anne home with its first floor converted into retail space. The first floor has large, plate glass windows, with a green, vinyl awning across the facade facing Whitney Ave--alterations made in the mid 20th century. The south side of the building has stairs leading down into the Caseus cheese shop, connected to the Caseus restaurant. Above the first floor, many of the original Queen Anne features remain. An asymmetrical facade looks out towards Whitney and Phelps Triangle Park, adorned with several decorative elements including tan half timbering over the red brick, terra cotta tiles, slate and wooden fish scales, and bricks in herring bone pattern. Exaggerated brackets punctuate the façade under the third-floor balcony, the scalloped gables, and overhanging eaves. The north side seems to have a large oriel window that protrudes into the alleyway between the building and its neighbor. On top, the half hip roof is covered in slate tiles, interrupted by three interior chimneys (1).</p>','<p>The building is located at the intersection of Whitney and Trumbull, a busy area filled with commercial and residential spaces. The plate glass windows of the first floor blend in with the stores, restaurants, and offices north and south of the building on Whitney. One often sees Yalies and other New Haven residents from the surrounding neighborhood ducking into Caseus, The Hive, or Fashionista during an afternoon in the Whitney-Audobon neighborhood, an area filled with arts spaces, restaurants, and shops. And yet, the playful ornamentation of the second and third stories also call to the elegant Yale University buildings on Hillhouse Ave., just one block to the west. Like the Arthur Twining Hadley house, many of the classroom and office buildings on Hillhouse were once large, stately homes of the New Haven elite and retain many of their features that were fashionable in the 19th century.</p>','41.313145','93 Whitney, LLC.

However, it underwent renovations to convert the bottom floor into retail space over the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Additionally, the use of both 93½ and 93 Whitney in city directories of 1970, 1980, and 1990, suggest that there may have been an addition built onto the building in the mid 20<sup>th</sup> century (5)(6)(7).

Grant Elementary School</p>','<p><span style="color: black;">A brand new, state of the art preschool serving New Haven children ages 2-4. The building is two stories, with a red and yellow brick facade and simple, colorful detailing. Two wings of the building intersect at right angles to form an L shape. The main entrance is a round atrium formed by a white steel frame holding glass doors, windows, and colored panels. The top of the entrance is capped with a subtle cornice. Just outside of the main entrance to the school stands the bell tower, a component of the Helene W. Grant School which previously occupied the site and a reminder of the commitment towards modernization that school represented. Construction of the Dr. Reginald Mayo School was undertaken as an effort by the City of New Haven to renovate all of its public schools and was completed in September of 2016.</span></p>','<p><span style="color: black;">The Dr. Reginald Mayo School was designed by the New Haven architecture firm Kenneth Boroson Architects. Viewed from the outside, the school is immediately distinguishable from its surroundings. The scale of the building-comprised of two floors covering over 70,000 square feet-is greater than any of the adjacent housing complexes. And, built in 2016, the building shows none of the signs of weathering or degradation that are apparent throughout the surrounding neighborhood. Double paned windows are framed in square 2x2 grids and set in white sills which, despite being unable to open, are nonetheless handsome. In sharp contrast to the gray and beige tones of the row houses surrounding it, the Dr. Reginald Mayo School goes to great lengths to emphasize color. The exterior walls are colored with pastel painted squares of red, green, blue, purple, yellow, and orange, all the colors a preschooler could name. The brickwork plays with color and patterns as well; masonry volumes of red brick with yellow stripes are interspersed with yellow volumes with red stripes, maintaining a sort of horizontal continuity between each segment of the L shaped schoolhouse. Halfway up the facade, in between the first floor and second floor windows, is placed the occasional blue brick. It is a small detail, but an important one; from a certain angle, the striated brick walls come close to resembling commercial real estate, maybe a Walgreens or CVS. The painted panels and spots of blue on the otherwise mundane red and yellow brick might help to remind passersby that the building really is a preschool. One of the more curious aspects of the school’s design is the bell tower, which stands just outside the main entrance of the school. The square pillar is not made of steel or brick, as is the main building, but concrete. It is capped with four brass bells. If the bell tower seems slightly at odds with the design of the school, that would be because it is a relic. It is the only remaining piece of the Helene W. Grant School which, in 2014, was demolished to make space for the current building. </span></p>','<p><span style="color: black;">The Dr. Reginald Mayo Early Childhood School is located on Goffe Street and occupies a central location in the Dixwell neighborhood northwest of downtown New Haven. Most nearby space is residential; the buildings immediately adjacent are family row houses. The school is only a few blocks away from the Yale Campus, and Yale has a large presence in the Dixwell neighborhood: a few blocks to the East, the top of Klein Biology Tower peaks up above tree tops and roofs. To the south, the rectangular volume of Payne Whitney Gym is visible down Goffe Street. Of the four new residential colleges Yale has built since the 1950s, all occupy space in Dixwell. At Scantlebury Park, the futuristic architecture of Yale Health looks out over a children’s playground at modest and slightly run down Victorian style suburban houses. Despite Yale’s presence in the neighborhood, Dixwell remains one of New Haven’s poorer districts. The canal path runs through Dixwell, along which lies Science Park, a Yale associated startup incubator. One block up the hill is where the Winchester Repeating Rifle Company once operated ((1987) National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination Form. N. P. Service, United States Department of the Interior). The factory, now on the national register of historic places, sits abandoned. </span></p>','<p>	<span style="color: black;">Although the building itself was constructed only recently, the Dr. Reginald Mayo School marks the continuation of a narrative that dates back to at least the mid twentieth century. New Haven in the 1960s was in many ways a poster city of the national progressive theories of urban planning, redevelopment, and renewal. The then mayor of New Haven, Mayor Richard C. Lee, was instrumental in supporting, organizing, and obtaining funding for projects ranging from neighborhood clean-up campaigns to the clearing of slums and construction of commercial space, schools, and recreational facilities (1). In particular, the neighborhood of Dixwell became a focus of urban redevelopment efforts: “Over $200 million in public money has been funneled into New Haven since the city\'s huge rehabilitation program.… Of that money, more than $21 million has gone towards reviving Dixwell” (2).&nbsp;In this effort, coined the Dixwell Redevelopment Plan, the majority African American residents of Dixwell were the subjects of a national experiment to implement progressive theories of urban planning. At the time, theories advocated for the clearing of the worst areas and the construction of new urban infrastructure, including housing, highways, parks, recreational centers, commercial centers, and educational facilities (1). One such project, the Helene W. Grant School, was constructed in 1964 and was a centerpoint of the Dixwell Redevelopment Plan (3).</span></p><p>	<span style="color: black;">While many aspects of New Haven urban redevelopment in the 1960s found notable success, efforts to revitalize Dixwell were largely unsuccessful. The neighborhood, already in decline at the onset of the redevelopment campaign, was hurt by the New Haven riots in the late 1960s and never received the same level of attention or funding from the city government (2). Additionally, by the 1970s, prevailing beliefs about urban renewal had essentially pivoted.</span></p><p>	<span style="color: black;">More recently, revitalization has taken on a different form in New Haven. In the 1990s, the mayor of New Haven from 1994 up to 2014, John deStefano Jr., introduced the “Livable City Initiative.” The campaign adapted many of the same themes of the sixties redevelopment movement, including an emphasis on implementing new housing projects, cleaning and updating urban parks, and especially renovating schools as a large part of the strategy for improving New Haven (4).</span></p><p>	<span style="color: black;">In 1995, deStefano implemented the School Construction Program, which budgeted 1.5 billion dollars over the span of 15 years to renovate or rebuild every one of New Haven’s public schools. It was out of this initiative that the Dr. Reginald Mayo School was constructed.</span></p>','<p>	<span style="color: black;">The site on which the Dr. Reginald Mayo School sits was initially developed as residential housing. In the 1960s, New Haven ran a campaign to redevelop some of the worst slums in the city. In particular, the Dixwell neighborhood was championed as a test case for national theories of urban planning and renewal. In 1964, a number of residential lots on the site were cleared to build the Helene W. Grant School, named after the influential African American educator Helene Grant. The school was built according to the most modern and progressive theories of the time; the architecture of the school was modern, in the brutalist style. Classrooms facilities were single floors, with open rooms that let in natural light and were intended to allow nature into the classroom (</span>3<span style="color: black;">). The Helene Grant School existed until 2014, when it was cleared due to a number of factors, including the discovery of hazardous materials in the building (5). Construction on the Dr. Reginald Mayo School took place from 2014 to September of 2016. The school is now open and currently enrolls 477 preschool students (6).</span></p>','<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: black;">Von Zielbauer, Paul. “Richard C.

Set off from the street on a corner lot in the Dwight-Edgewood neighborhood, the building is notable for its irregular C-shaped form, its alternating, projecting balconies protruding from the second to fourteenth floors, and its tan, ribbed concrete outer surface [1]. The building serves as an icon of New Haven’s mid-1960s affordable housing boom, after the era of urban renewal, driven by Mayor Richard C. Lee, led to the destruction of 129 acres of housing—particularly along the route of the Oak Street Connector, which was completed in 1959; North Frontage Road, which bounds the Crawford Manor lot to the southwest, was built as an extension of the Connector. Its 109 single- and double-occupant units are still in use today [1,4]. Described as “the popular press’s ideal choice for the role of American Form-Giver of the Space Age,” Rudolph was noted for his range of experimental, international-style designs, including the Yale Art and Architecture Building, a 1,500-car parking garage in downtown New Haven, the U.S. Embassy in Amman, Jordan, and the nondenominational chapel at Alabama’s Tuskegee Institute [6,3]. Crawford Manor was one of the sole instances in which Rudolph applied his principles of high design to affordable housing, utilizing thirteen customized and uniquely shaped concrete blocks with vertically ribbed surfaces and narrow ribbed surfaces to create cheaply installed, prefabricated units at minimal construction and maintenance cost [1]. In September 1966, Crawford Manor was one of seven buildings nationwide distinguished by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Project Design Award; with minimal renovations in its fifty-two years of occupancy, Rudolph’s tower has stood the test of time [1,4].</span></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Crawford Manor contains many elements of Paul Rudolph’s distinctive modernist ethos, expressed through several material and design innovations necessitated by the project’s constraints [1,7]. The tower was financed by federal urban renewal funding; its $1,525,000 budget placed stringent limits on Rudolph’s design, but, through his innovations, the total development cost exceeded that budget by only $60,000 [1,13]. The fifteen-story tower is C-shaped, and consists of two central piers, on either side of the glass-paneled main entrance, with two wings curving outward into the parking lot on the north and west sides of the property, creating a small enclosed courtyard on the front facade [1]. The building reflects several classic principles of brutalism, including its use of exposed materials, its focus on utility and interior space, and its massive scale [1].</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The building’s most distinctive feature is the cantilevered, curved, three-by-six-foot balconies rising at alternating perpendicular angles from the wings [1]. The balconies, which protrude in a regular pattern from the second through fourteenth floors, give the building a sense of “pragmatic monumentality,” and, along with the vertically ribbed concrete exterior, emphasize the tower’s verticality [1,3]. The building is steel-framed and built with poured concrete; the exterior consists of 175,000 tan concrete blocks sealed with mortar [1]. These blocks are the most novel design innovation of the tower; Rudolph personally designed thirteen unique blocks, which were prefabricated to reduce the building’s construction costs by eliminating the need for onsite casting [3,1]. The ribbing was meant to redirect rainwater to reduce staining and allow for easy cleaning, lowering maintenance costs [1].</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Crawford Manor’s external form facilitates the pragmatism of its interior, which contains 109 units, including 52 300-square-foot studio units, 52 400-square-foot studio units, and 5 600-square-foot two-bedroom units [13]. The C-shape allowed Rudolph to create irregular apartment layouts that facilitated a range of activities [1]. The balconies, which formed lintels for the floors below, were accompanied by metal frame windows, above and below, creating an abundance of interior lighting [1]. Amidst the white poured-concrete ceilings and walls, the elevator and unit doors on each floor are painted different colors to help the elderly residents distinguish between them [1].</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The building has changed minimally since its completion in the fall of 1966. Aside from significant renovations to improve the accessibility of units on the second through seventh floors and repair the exterior in 1997, and substantial balcony restorations and electrical improvements in 2002 and 2003, the building has otherwise undergone only minor restoration and has experienced no significant alterations in the last five decades [4]. Still, it remains in good condition.</span></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Crawford Manor dominates its immediate landscape, rising up above the surrounding parking lots and two-to-three story brick buildings and Greek Revival homes. Located two blocks northeast of Yale-New Haven Hospital, the tower is set off thirty feet from the Park Street and North Frontage Road, bounded by fenced-in green space to the south and east and a resident-only parking lot and community garden, run by the New Haven Land Trust, to the north and west [1]. Paul Rudolph’s early works expressed a wide variety of styles, motivated by his ambition to accommodate his buildings to their surrounding environment [5,3]. However, designs like Crawford Manor and the Art and Architecture Building demonstrated a departure from this grounding ethos; instead of responding to the existing ambient, they create an entirely new one, a stark, monumental contrast to the bordering blocks [3]. Even today, Crawford Manor’s relationship to its setting reflects a mantra of consolidation and control, undergirded by a disregard of the city’s poor residents, that officials like Mayor Lee employed in their drive for urban renewal.</span></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Crawford Manor has been occupied by low-income senior residents of New Haven, and owned by the city Housing Authority, since its construction from 1964 to 1966 [2,4]. The Housing Authority of New Haven was established in 1938, in the wake of the New Deal-era Housing Act of 1937 [1]. After overseeing three large public housing projects from 1939 to 1941, HANH turned its attention to senior housing in the 1960s [1]. In 1962, with the city plagued by housing shortages in the wake of the Connector’s construction, 400 applications were submitted for 219 impending senior housing units; Crawford Manor, with twice as many units as any other other public housing building erected at this time, played a significant role in alleviating this shortage [1].</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As the city’s preeminent architect in the era of urban renewal, Paul Rudolph saw the Oak Street Connector as the “gateway to New Haven” [7]. As was typical for architects of the era, Rudolph considered urban design in relation to the channels along which automobiles flowed; he felt the city should declare its character outward from the highway [7]. Thus, Crawford Manor was built to fulfill a dual function: providing affordable housing for seniors, and broadcasting the city’s industrial might and aesthetic grandeur to passersby on the street and commuters on the Oak Street Connector [1]. The building remains a fully operational residence. When I visited, I spotted clothes, chairs, and a bike on the balconies, and the lobby was bustling.</span></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Crawford Manor lies along North Frontage Road, an extension of the Oak Street Connector, built following the clearance of 129 acres of officially designated “slum” or “underutilized” areas during the era of urban renewal (as mentioned above) [1]. Sanborn fire insurance maps of New Haven, updated in 1966, show the block previously contained with close to a dozen houses and two large apartment buildings where the Manor, North Frontage Road, and a parking lot now lie [11].</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Crawford Manor is notable among New Haven’s public housing projects of the urban renewal era. Large-scale redevelopment projects increased the city’s number of housing units by 6 percent in the 1960s, and senior housing projects were prioritized as part of a $10.8 million plan to redevelop the Dwight Neighborhood [1]. Rudolph began planning the building in 1962; construction by Giordano Construction Company, of Branford, Connecticut, began in summer 1965 and was completed in fall 1966, and the building was fully occupied by October 23 of that year [2,1]. Therefore, Crawford Manor is emblematic of the New Haven’s redevelopment in the 1960s; it’s a looming presence amidst the city’s pockmarked, unevenly developed downtown landscape.</span></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">1.

Its brutalist style has resulted in a plethora of clear forms and shapes that cascade up to the corner of George &amp; State Streets. The hard concrete positions the building as a harsh-seeming island in a sea of asphalt parking, a condition that has afflicted the site ever since the New Haven Coliseum was demolished in 2007 [23]. Yet the main entrance offers an elegant staircase, with smooth curves that accent the elevated main floor, where retrofitted exhibitions designed by Kevin Roche make for an uneasy, yet ultimately satisfying relationship with the building’s original interior.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The building is monumental, but its site should be considered second in importance only to the Green. The connection of the nine squares to the harbor, the funneling of railways, the power of industry, and a few forgotten secrets make this site one you shouldn’t overlook.</span></p>','<p>	<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Knights of Columbus Museum sits as an island in a sea of parking &amp; unusable land&nbsp;just southeast of the 9th Square. To the north: parking. To the west: parking. To the south: an underpass. To the east: a railroad cut. Even the Hertz Rent-a-car building, situated diagonally across from the museum at the intersection of State &amp; George, shrinks away from the street, a buffer of parking separating it from the museum’s concrete crown. </span></p><p>	<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The demolition of the New Haven Coliseum in 2007 is the main culprit for this urban isolation, followed by its subsequent lack of redevelopment [23]. Today, the buildings only shelter seems to be the constant flow of cars on State Street, which surrounds the building with its split one-way traffic: northbound to the right, southbound to the left. There are current proposals to make State Street two-way, potentially opening the space between the Knights of Columbus Museum and the railroad tracks [19]. </span></p><p>	<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">With the developing 9th Square district and growing Wooster Square neighborhood, coupled with the potential transformation of the Coliseum site, there is much that could change in the near future for the building’s urban setting [19, 20, 23]. For now, it stands alone, its concrete cornice towering above the cars and streetlights.</span></p>','<p>	<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Knights of Columbus Museum is one of New Haven’s finest examples of Brutalist architecture. The structure, built out of reinforced concrete, is monotonic in material. What makes the building spectacular, however, are the forms into which the material was molded. The most prominent part of the building is at the corner of George &amp; State, where all three stories are present. Elsewhere, only two stories exist. At this corner, the two main slabs of the building: the top, thinner slab providing a roof for the 3rd floor &amp; the lower, thicker slab containing the 2nd floor, reach a corner. At this corner, a concrete cylinder punches through both slabs (causing a break in the thicker slab) to the tallest point in the building. The corner cylinder is clearly made out of several blocks of concrete, whose lines of division become clear as one approaches the building. The vertical lines accent the cylinder’s dynamic push to the sky, whereas the horizontal lines match up with the intersecting slabs, connecting the cylinder to the floors it supports. A single, rounded-edge rectangle decorates the top of this cylinder, acting as a floating cornice. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">	Below this cylinder, at the main entrance of the building, one finds the elegant curved, concrete staircase that swoops down from the elevated first floor to the street. The entire building, one should note, is elevated above the ground with a series of pilotis that run around the entire structure. Below the first floor of the building is the parking lot, a smart use of space that also allows breezes to enter the courtyard.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">	Due to the site’s odd shape (with no right angles), the building is a quadrilateral, each side set at a different angle. The building forms a thick collar around a central void: the courtyard (originally called the Jackson Courtyard). Inside this space one finds a water pool and cascade in the form of small steps. Stairs are located next to these steps, which lead to a semilinear ridge adorned with a statue of Christopher Columbus. Small walls line the courtyard. The walkable steps angle themselves towards these walls. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">	One of the most notable features about this courtyard is the presence of bamboo trees [9]. These shoots give a sense of verticality to counter the horizontality that the slabs and long rows of glass panels evoke. That being said, the glass panels face the courtyard, giving the building a much more transparent feeling than upon viewing it from the street (where more concrete is visible). The glass on both sides, however, is tinted black. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">	Utilities and vertical movements are separated in the building, exiled to extruding forms. For instance, consider the corner cylinder. It is more than a piece of abstract brutalist art: it contains the elevator bank and shaft in the half facing the interior, and holds utility rooms in the other half. Elsewhere, four ovals that stick out of the building in a similar, but lesser way to the cylinder, contain the stairs. There is one for each side of the building. Each of these ovals extend to about the height of the third floor (save for the one next to the cylinder, which goes higher). In the space above the built-up, flat roof, the walls of the oval continue above the roof of the oval and have a small slit cut out of both linear sides). This slit cutout is mimicked in the cylinder. </span></p><p>	<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Restrooms and more utility rooms are located in stubbed, circular buildings that break from the collar of the building and place themselves in the courtyard. One should note that of all the forms in the building, the restroom/utility rooms have the roughest concrete texture, chipped in a method akin to Rudolph’s Art &amp; Architecture Building.</span></p><p>	<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As for external architecture, a short wall runs around the perimeter of the building (the building itself is setback from the street), which, coupled with the sunken parking lot beneath the first floor, forms a quasi-moat.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">	Concerning the interior, one must note that it is not original to building designed by Orr, DeCossy, Winder &amp; Associates. After the Knights of Columbus bought the building in 1994, they soon hired Kevin Roche, architect of their prominent headquarters, to redo the interior to fit their new museum, which opened in 2001. The only interiors that appear original are the elevators &amp; some of the walls that belong to the cylinder, circular, and oval spaces.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">	The entrance was in the same location as it is today. A hallway encircled the courtyard, providing panoramic views of the building’s main void. The rest of the building was compartmentalized into several groupings of offices and clinics, usually with only one entrance that would lead to a large common space or a smaller, parallel hallway. Meeting rooms were in the eastern side of the building. During the renovations, a grand staircase was added to the lobby, with an added skylight. The main hallway around the courtyard was kept, but the interior rooms were heavily altered. The small offices were cleared to make way for large exhibition rooms, a theater, and even (most recently) a recreation of a World War I trench. The eastern side of the building was completely taken apart and replaced with one long, wavering exhibition wall &amp; media center.</span></p>','<p>	<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Knights of Columbus were not the first tenants of 1 State Street. The construction of the building came from the need to consolidate both health and welfare programs into a single building [9, 11, 12, 13]. &nbsp;Hence, the original name was the Community Services Building [9, 11, 13]. The idea of constructing a new building rather than retrofitting an older building developed in 1962, during the climax of New Haven’s era of urban renewal [9]. Suburbanization and downtown decline were forcing the city to attempt radical solutions to retain customers in the urban core. During the 1950s and 60s, New Haven received the fifth largest and highest per capita amount of federal capital grants for urban renewal ($27,424,108 in total; $745.68 per capita) [14]. Mayor Richard C. Lee was the man responsible for obtaining this funding, and was urban renewal’s crusader in the Elm City [14]. His programs would lead to the destruction of the Oak St. neighborhood, the demolition of the southeastern edge of downtown, and the construction of the Oak St. Connector, all of which opened up space for the Community Services Building [9, 14]. The site was given by the New Haven Redevelopment Agency [9, 14]. Funding came from the New Haven Foundation (today the Foundation for Greater New Haven), which would join the first set of tenants in the building [9].</span></p><p>	<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Community Services Building was designed by Orr, DeCossy, Winder and Associates, and was one of the final buildings to be designed in Douglas Orr’s lifetime (he died in 1966) [9]. The primary architect, however, was not Orr, but DeCossy [9]. A Yale student and later a Yale professor, DeCossy’s work would receive praise, being described as having “achieved a feeling of interconnectedness among the mix of governmental and voluntary agencies housed in the building” [3, 9]. Orr’s firm had not entered the Modernist (or Brutalist) style until both DeCossy and Winder entered the firm [9]. </span></p><p>	<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The building was constructed in 1965 [9]. It offered many offices, six meeting rooms, and a 3rd floor cafeteria. Parking was found below the building. The first tenants were, among others, organizations such as the New Haven Foundation, the Urban League of Greater New Haven, the Travelers Aid Society of New Haven, the Girl Scouts, the Homemaker Services Bureau of Greater New Haven, the United Way, the Visiting Nurse Association of Greater New Haven, the New Haven Health Department Clinics, and the Condo Association for the building [36]. The building was designed as the first condo association in Connecticut: tenants would pay a required fee in order to cover maintenance costs and the use of common areas (such as a third floor cafeteria) [9]. The edifice with all its organizations within, must have been an incredible place, the meshing of a variety of people from all walks of life relaxing in the Jackson Courtyard and the cafeteria.</span></p><p>	<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">An incredible amount of charity, service, and assistance emanated from the Community Services Building. The Travelers Aid Society was a network built to support the homeless [10]. Arc of Greater New Haven supported (and continues to support) those with mental disabilities [2]. The Urban League of Greater New Haven (now the Urban League of Southern Connecticut) was formed to empower marginalized communities in the city [25]. Even the unassuming Morton J. Loeb dental clinic was founded in 1934 to “provide through the practical application of dentistry, the benefit of necessary dental care only to persons who are referred to the clinic from recognized welfare agencies” [12]. The six meeting rooms were used for a variety of purposes related to the organizations located in the building. To provide a typical example: in 1975, a meeting to discuss the potential loss of funding for a drug abuse program was set for 1 PM, Friday, November 14th, 1975 in the Community Services Building. Health planning and community council agencies from all over Connecticut attended [15].</span></p><p>	<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Writing about the Loeb Dental Clinic, Milton Lisansky coined it as the center of “New Haven’s comprehensive human renewal program” [12]. It is a harsh building for such a warm purpose.</span></p><p>	<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Through 1980, most of these organizations remained in the Community Services Building, its abstract tower at State &amp; George acting as a concrete lighthouse to alert passerbys to the plethora of generous and helpful organizations within. Of a minor concern, one vacancy had popped up [38]. By 1990, however, there was a drop in use [39]. Many organizations left and the condo association fell through [9]. Nine organizations remained in the building where there had been 18 in 1980 [38, 39]. Although a upturn in 1994 saw the building with 16 organizations, only six came from the original set [40]. </span></p><p>	<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">That same year, the Knights of Columbus purchased the building and by 1995, the Knights of Columbus had an office presence in the building, although they still shared it with one previous tenant: the Institute for Family [9, 41]. But the Knights had bigger plans: a museum. In 2001, after an extensive renovation by Tony Spagnola and Kevin Roche (the same architect of the Knights of Columbus’ headquarters, which was separated from the Community Services Building at the time by the New Haven Coliseum), the Knights of Columbus Museum opened on Saturday, March 19, 2001 [6]. Much of the original interior was gutted in order to make room for 77,000 square feet of exhibition space [11].</span></p><p>	<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">What happened to the organizations that left the Community Services Building? All of them either closed or left. Today, the remaining organizations are strong, but spatially disassociated. The United Way finds itself on James Street in northern Fair Haven; the Urban League is now on Grand Avenue [24, 25]. ARC is now in Hamden, and the Girl Scouts are in North Haven [2, 8]. 1 Long Wharf Drive, a former industrial building near Union Station, is the only building to house more than one of the original Community Services Building tenants: the Visiting Nurse Association &amp; Family Counseling of Greater New Haven [26, 28]. The location, however, is dismal: a building on a dead-end road, cut off from New Haven by fences, an extended-stay hotel, and the railroad tracks. </span></p><p>	<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The current program in the building, however, is interesting: it is a method for the Knights of Columbus to communicate their ideals and vision through a free, interactive series of exhibits that are open to the public. The building is a relaxed space, accented by the courtyard, which during the museum conversion was retrofitted with a statue of “Columbus the Evangelist”, a work by Stanley Bliefield [11]. The museum provides another tourist attraction for the Elm City, and a physical space that any pilgrims to the Knights of Columbus can visit. That being said, one might yearn for another community services building to be built. Although an integrated building for such organizations is not necessary (and many of the organizations have continued successfully on their own), such a complex would be a tangible space of giving, of charity, and of service to New Haven. Indeed, there are several empty lots that surround the Knights of Columbus Museum.</span></p>','<p>	<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Equally as fascinating as the building’s design and use is the Community Service Building’s site. I defend the proposition that this site is the most historically important site in New Haven after the Green. To understand why, one must travel back to New Haven’s original nine square plan. With biblical origins, Vincent Scully calls the vision of New Haven: “the nine square city by the sea, the red mountain flaring. It is the new Jerusalem, the most perfect of all Puritan towns” [22].</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">	“Most perfect”, perhaps, but if there was one issue with this “nine square city </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">by the sea</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">,” it was that none of the nine squares touched the sea, aka New Haven Harbor. Douglas Rae confirms in </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">CITY: Urbanism and Its End</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, that “the dominant form of urban promise was the harbor city” [14]. Water was also a necessity for travel in the colonial era. Thus, despite being only a few minutes walk to the water, the nine squares had to be connected to New Haven Harbor via road. It should then be no surprise that some of the earliest concentrations of development in the Elm City were along the strip of land that led from the southeastern corner of the nine squares (State &amp; George) to the harbor [43]. This route bordered one of the early streams of the city, which paralleled State Street [43]. Our site’s inception is credited to a need of mobility, a theme that will define the site for its lifetime.</span></p><p>	<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As far back as 1641, such notable residents as Thomas Trowbridge had their homes along this vital site [43]. Trowbridge, one of the first settlers of New Haven, helped establish the first Congregational Church, but, due to tax evasion, had to escape back to England. His children, and his legacy, were left in New Haven [1]. His family would occupy the State Street area into the early 1800s [44].</span></p><p>	<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The strip of land connecting the nine squares to the harbor soon became a street, called “Fleet Street” [44]. Not only did it connect to the harbor, but also to the largest piece of waterfront infrastructure at the time: Long Wharf. With development starting in 1754, the wharf was, essentially, an extension of Fleet Street [21]. By 1851, a new form of transit highlighted the importance of the CSB site: the railroad. Skirting Fleet Street and replacing the stream that had been there in the 1600s, the railroad formed the permanent eastern border of the contemporary site [44]. Around this time, New Haven expanded eastward with streets such as Fair and Water Street, creating the northern and southern borders of the site, respectively [44]. Water Street was named because at the time, it was on the water. The CSB site, now complete, had an irregular shape due to the curved railway and angled Fleet Street. The site had also densified, with a solid block of buildings stretching along the Fleet Street between Fair and Water [44]. At the intersection of Fleet and Water, a square had been created with New Haven Harbor and Long Wharf as its southern border [44]. By 1879 the introduction of the streetcar had further increased the importance of the site: Custom House Square was along a prominent trolley route: connecting downtown to the train station [42]. Fleet Street had also been erased: it was made a continuation of State St. [42]. </span></p><p>	<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The site’s proximity to the harbor would not last. The railroads built infill into the harbor, allowing for a larger staging area. By 1886, the shoreline had already moved farther away from Custom House Square and the site [45].</span></p><p>	<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">At the same time, the era of industrialization swept the Elm City, and due to the site’s prominent position at the center of water and land transportation, it naturally became a focal point for industry. In 1886, the CSB site contained storage houses, wholesale grocers, vinegar works and tin shops. A. C. Blenner &amp; Company had a Pickle Factory right on State [45]. Larger factories couldn’t be built due to the site’s irregular shape. Across the street, the New Haven Baking Company and W. M. Hull &amp; Son Brewery operated far bigger plants [45]. </span></p><p>	<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The site was also becoming mixed use: restaurants, shops, and residences could be found [45]. Mobility would continue to be a reoccurring theme for the site, as in 1906, another feature of the site developed: the trolley viaduct. Announced in 1906 and built in 1907, the concrete viaduct carried streetcars, and </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">only </em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">streetcars, parallel to State St., avoiding the traffic of the mixed street [16, 18]. Few records exist of this unique piece of infrastructure.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">	The viaduct came at a good time. By 1913, the street was absolutely packed. On the block between Water and Fair Streets, multiple barbershops, saloons, restaurants, and hotels had popped up. The industrial might of the site, however, had not been lost. Miner Read &amp; Tucker Wholesale Grocers was one of the most prominent companies in the site proper, but besides them, there was Sulzberger &amp; Sons Wholesale Beef, The Cudahy Packing Company, and the New Haven Tobacco Company [29]. On Fair Street, between State and the viaduct, one could find the Armour &amp; Co, selling wholesale provisions and “etc” [29]. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">	This lively nature of the site would continue for quite some time. In 1924, existing businesses had expanded even further: Armour &amp; Co had doubled their size by building underneath the streetcar viaduct; Miner, Read &amp; Tullock now dominated the corner of State &amp; Water; two new wholesale beef houses had opened; a printing shop had come to be; shops continued to thrive; and a little coffee roasting shop squeezed itself in between two of the large wholesale suppliers [46].</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">	As 1930 rolled by, the area stayed pretty similar to how it had been before. Miner, Read &amp; Tucker; The Cudahy Packing Company; Armour &amp; Co all remained, but a new type of store arrived: auto supplies [30]. A few vacancies also began to pop up. By 1940, much was the same: the same industry, the same vacancies, and the same car shops [30]. The Standard Beef Company as well as Wilson &amp; Company were new names, but the function of the site remained the same: industry with some mixed retail [30]. The Central Cold Storage Corporation opened next to Armour &amp; Co [31]. But the automobile was gaining traction in the American psyche, and slowly, downtowns were becoming obsolete. In 1950 more automobile parts stores appeared, as did vacancies [32]. New Haven’s trolley system had been replaced with buses in 1948. It is presumed that the viaduct went out of service with it [27]. Central Cold Storage, Armor &amp; Co., and the rest of the major companies remained as they were [32].</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">	By 1960, all had changed. Miner, Read &amp; Tucker; The Cudahy Packing Company; and Armour &amp; Co. were gone [33]. There were more vacancies than ever before [33]. The trolley viaduct had been converted into a one-way road to complement State Street [17]. A few food manufacturers remained, but even the automobile shops had left [33]. Downtown, facing growing competition from the automobile suburbs, was beginning to be perceived as obsolete. In 1964, the only original company left was the Standard Beef Company [34]. Nearly half the buildings were vacant [34]. Central Cold Storage remained [35]. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">	The site would be skirted to its south by the Oak Street Connector, a destructive, failed highway project that originally intended to go the Naugatuck Valley, but instead ended abruptly at York Street, destroying 350 buildings and displacing 850 families [17].</span></p><p>	<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">By 1965, all of the buildings on site had been cleared of occupancy [35]. Richard Lee’s urban renewal program was in full swing. The wrecking balls laid waste to the entire area, from the railroad tracks as far as Temple Street. More families were displaced, and a minority neighborhood was completely obliterated. Yet, the Central Cold Storage remained [35]. It would persist until 1972, the same year the New Haven Coliseum was finished, when the final remains of 1 State Street’s site’s industrial past would be left vacant and eventually erased [37].</span></p><p>	<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">But how to reconcile the associated destruction of Oak Street with the construction of the Community Services Building? Whereas the utility of what replaced Oak Street in other locations, such as office towers, parking lots, highways, and an eventual stadium, is questionable, the concentrated welfare and health organizations was indeed beneficial to the community. One should also note that the building was able to hide its 97 parking spots underneath, therefore not requiring further space [9]. And we cannot forget the building’s purpose: not of urban renewal, but of human renewal.</span></p>','<p><strong>SOURCES:</strong></p><p><br></p><ol><li>Amaranted, Joe. “Cindy Crawford discovers her New Haven roots.” <em>New Haven Register, </em>August 26, 2013. <a href="https://www.nhregister.com/connecticut/article/Cindy-Crawford-discovers-her-New-Haven-roots-11412335.php" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">https://www.nhregister.com/connecticut/article/Cindy-Crawford-discovers-her-New-Haven-roots-11412335.php</a> </li><li>ARC of Greater New Haven, Inc. “Home.” Accessed February 25, 2018. <a href="https://www.arcgnh.org/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">https://www.arcgnh.org/</a>.</li><li>Bernstein, Fred A. “A Home That Offered a Second Chance.” <em>The New York Times, </em>September 5, 2008. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/07/realestate/07habi.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/07/realestate/07habi.html</a>. </li><li>City of New Haven. “Elderly Services.” Accessed February 25, 2018. <a href="https://www.newhavenct.gov/gov/depts/elderly/default.htm" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">https://www.newhavenct.gov/gov/depts/elderly/default.htm</a>.</li><li>Clifford Beers Clinic. “Contact Us.” Accessed February 25, 2018. <a href="http://www.cliffordbeers.org/contact/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">http://www.cliffordbeers.org/contact/</a>. </li><li>Curren, Elizabeth G. “HERE ‘N’ THERE Knights open museum in fine style.” <em>New Haven Register, </em>March 18, 2001. <a href="https://www.nhregister.com/news/article/HERE-N-THERE-Knights-open-museum-in-fine-style-11702656.php" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">https://www.nhregister.com/news/article/HERE-N-THERE-Knights-open-museum-in-fine-style-11702656.php</a>.</li><li>Foundation for Greater New Haven. “New Haven Healthy Start.” Accessed February 25, 2018. <a href="http://www.cfgnh.org/LeadingOnIssues/HealthyFamilies/NewHavenHealthyStart.aspx" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">http://www.cfgnh.org/LeadingOnIssues/HealthyFamilies/NewHavenHealthyStart.aspx</a>. </li><li>Girl Scouts of Connecticut. “Main Page.” Accessed February 25, 2018. <a href="https://www.gsofct.org/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">https://www.gsofct.org/</a> </li><li>Historic Resources Inventory - Building and Structures. “Knights of Columbus Museum - Community Services Building.” Accessed February 21, 2018. <a href="http://newhavenmodern.org/system/dragonfly/production/2017/09/03/6iqsr8jqh6_HRI_2017_StateSt_1_CommunityServices_final.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">http://newhavenmodern.org/system/dragonfly/production/2017/09/03/6iqsr8jqh6_HRI_2017_StateSt_1_CommunityServices_final.pdf</a>.</li><li>Homeless and Travelers Aid Society. “Home.” Accessed February 25, 2018. <a href="http://hatas.org/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">http://hatas.org/</a>.</li><li>Leeney, Robert J. “EDITOR’S NOTE: A new museum for the Knights, city.” <em>New Haven Register, </em>February 24, 2001. <a href="https://www.nhregister.com/news/article/EDITOR-S-NOTEA-new-museum-for-the-Knights-city-11698107.php" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">https://www.nhregister.com/news/article/EDITOR-S-NOTEA-new-museum-for-the-Knights-city-11698107.php</a> </li><li>Lisansky, Milton. “Dental Care in a Voluntary Agency: The M.

The current clubhouse was the second to be built on the property and was completed in 1931.</span></p>','<p><span style="color: black;">The New Haven Lawn Club is a private club that offers outdoor tennis, paddle tennis, swimming, indoor squash, community activities, and dining to members and their guests. Located in the heart of New Haven, the clubhouse has been at the center of the city’s social life for more than 125 years and continues to host many events, concerts, dinners, dances, weddings, and celebrations. The New Haven Lawn Club has a storied past and was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 2003 (1). The Lawn Club’s history is intertwined with the professional and upper-class families of New Haven over the last century, including many Yale faculty and staff. </span></p>','<p><span style="color: black;">The New Haven Lawn Club structures include a main clubhouse, a pool house, eight full-size (and one half-size) outdoor tennis courts, two outdoor paddle courts, a 75-foot outdoor swimming pool, and a concrete shed. While the 1931 clubhouse is the primary focus of the National Register of Historic Places designation, the sprawling tennis courts retain their original historic layout and are considered a “contributing structure” in the building’s registration (2).</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: black;">The clubhouse was constructed in 1931 to replace one built in the 1890s that was destroyed by fire in 1929. The existing clubhouse anchors the Northern corner of the property in an expansive footprint that resembles an irregular W. The structure, oriented away from the parking areas, envelops the outdoor social space to the South. Towering white window frames stand guard above the depressed tennis courts and pool. The center block of the clubhouse houses the kitchen and a 200-person dining room on the main level and has a lower walk-out level in the rear with a Grill Room restaurant, lounge, and enclosed loggia area facing the courts (3).</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: black;">The clubhouse unabashedly exemplifies the streamlined Colonial Revival style prominent in the preceding decades, while weaving in elements of Art Moderne to develop a distinctive atmosphere fit for the city’s urban elites. The NRHP waxes poetic about the success of the brickwork in creating a “tension between tradition and modernity” to provide “a setting for play and socializing that blends comfort and elegance, familiarity and originality, formality and animation” (4). The design and materials used throughout the structure draw on an eclectic mixture to distinguish between the various components of the building and to create different atmospheres in the formal and less formal settings. The architects also brought in the influence of Streamline Moderne through their use of flat horizontality and, as the NRHP points out, “flat, hard surfaces with attenuated forms” and “zigzag shapes and references to machinery” (5).</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: black;">The majestic entrance to the clubhouse is flanked by a series of neat arches that cover porticos half-hidden behind green and white hedging. The eastern wing of the clubhouse includes a formal ballroom with large windows and a barrel ceiling, as well as a lobby on the ground floor. Four squash courts occupy the lower level below the ballroom. The western wing incorporates a more casual members’ lounge, lobby area, private dining and card rooms on the main floor with locker rooms and fitness center on the lower level. The fitness center was originally designed to be a badminton court but has been used as an air raid headquarters, teen recreation room, and storage over the years (6). The upper level of the clubhouse contains smaller rooms that are now offices, a boardroom, and six guest rooms or suites for members or their guests to use for overnight stays. The additional primary structures on the campus include eight tennis courts, two paddle ball courts, a 75-foot outdoor pool, and pool house (completed in 1989).&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: black;"><span class="ql-cursor">﻿</span>The clubhouse has undergone several renovations over the years to address changing membership needs and to update facilities. The most extensive renovations were undertaken in the 1980s when some rooms were reconfigured, and substantial interior decor renewed over two extensive projects totaling over $2 million. The same architecture firm was hired in order to remain true to its original design, according to New Haven Colonial Historical Society records (7).</span></p>','<p><span style="color: black;">The New Haven Lawn Club is a rare open area near the center of the city surrounded by institutional and commercial buildings and several older residences. The Lawn Club is located several blocks north of downtown New Haven on the northeastern edge of the Yale University campus. The Lawn Club and its facilities are situated on a hidden, interior lot of 6.38 acres, with access to Whitney Avenue to the west and Humphrey Street to the north. The Club is surrounded by the institutional buildings of Yale University to the south and west, including the School and Management and other commercial and administrative buildings. Several multi-family and single-family residences share the Lawn Clubs eastern and northern borders (8).</span></p><p><span style="color: black;"><br></span></p><p><span style="color: black;">The Lawn Club sits in the southern edge of the Whitney Avenue Historic District, </span><span style="color: black; background-color: white;">an extensive residential neighborhood that stretches north along Whitney Avenue and east to Orange Street (9). This Historic District was designated in 1989 and is primarily residential but includes some institutional buildings, such as churches, schools, and a fire station, as well as small commercial buildings. The architecture of the Whitney Avenue Historic District is dominated by the styles of the late-19th and early-20th centuries, particularly Queen Anne, Colonial Revival, and Tudor Revival (10).</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p>','<p><span style="color: black;">The New Haven Lawn Club Association was founded by members of New Haven’s old-line upper-middle class in the mid-1880s to create a place for leisure activities, including ‘lawn tennis’ and other sports. One of the earliest mentions of the Lawn Club can be found in the September 25, 1884 edition of the New Haven </span><em style="color: black;">Register, </em><span style="color: black;">which states that “prominent New Haven lovers of lawn tennis” planned to open courts, archery, and croquet grounds on Whitney Avenue (11). The Lawn Club formally incorporated in 1891 and purchased an interior piece of land with access to Whitney Avenue from Colonel Frank Fellows (12).</span></p><p><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: black;">Lawn tennis became increasingly popular in the late 19th century and considered suitable for women to play (13). Many athletic and country clubs were springing up around the U.S. as interest in sports and outdoor activities rose along with more leisure time for certain economic groups. The Lawn Club was one of the earliest social clubs to be built in New Haven or in the central Connecticut area, preceding the New Haven Country Club by more than ten years. Many regional and statewide tennis competitions were held at the Club regularly, including the first New England Tennis Championship in 1886 (14). The Lawn Club continued to host important tournaments and matches by national champions through the 1920s and 1930s, including the Connecticut State Championship (15). Other sports offered at the Club included squash, badminton, and bowling, as well as sledding and skating in the winter.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: black;">In addition to athletic activities, the Lawn Club served as a social focal point for New Haven’s elite class at the turn of the century. The original clubhouse included a stately ballroom and other dining and entertainment areas and offered dancing and social etiquette classes for children of members. From its very beginning, the New Haven Lawn Club carved out an important role as a venue for many local celebrations, dinners, weddings, concerts, parties, and important occasions. </span></p><p><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: black;">New Haven has a long history as a center for squash enthusiasts and it started at the Lawn Club (16). The original clubhouse incorporated two squash courts, two more were added in 1916 and a professional squash player hired to work with dedicated members (17). Five courts were included in the 1931 clubhouse building and have been converted to four international courts. Yale houses the U.S. Squash Hall of Fame and built the Brady Squash Center with 15 international courts which opened in 1999. Women’s intercollegiate squash had its origins in New Haven when the women Lawn Club members grew tired of including college players in their national Howe Cup tournament and convinced Yale to host the first intercollegiate women’s tournament in 1973 (18). Finally, in 2010, the Hopkins School, a college-preparatory school located in New Haven, converted part of a gym into the Kneisel Squash Center with six international squash courts. The Lawn Club has played an important role in building and maintaining the squash tradition in the central Connecticut area.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: black;">The original subscribers of the Lawn Club included many New Haven families from the business and academic elite and the membership grew to 350 families by 1890. Membership dipped in the late 1900s but grew again to more than 600 families by 1916 (19). While the number of memberships has fluctuated over the years, it has stabilized to number about 500 families. Original membership was limited to mostly white, protestant families and excluded “Catholics, Jews and newcomers,” according to Yale professor Douglas W. Rae (20). However, the Lawn Club has evolved to include new activities, children’s summer camps, and events that appeal to a broader range of the community.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: black;">The Lawn Club’s association with Yale goes back to the Club’s very inception. In the 1890s, Yale University held a mortgage for the New Haven Lawn Company and continued to provide second mortgages and loans in the years after the Company first incorporated (21). The Lawn Club membership included many Yale faculty and alumni who remained in the area after graduation. Given the Lawn Club’s proximity to Yale, many University-sponsored events and meetings continue to be held in its various dining rooms and the ballroom.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: black;">The architect for the 1931 clubhouse, Douglas William Orr, was an avid member of the Club and had already “developed a national reputation as an outstanding designer” according to a history of the Club prepared for a centennial celebration in 1991 (22). Orr had earned his Master’s in Architecture at Yale in 1929 and went on to build a thriving architecture firm based in New Haven. Mr. Orr served two terms as the President of the American Institute of Architects and served on a commission to renovate the Executive Mansion of the White House (23).</span></p><p><br></p>','<p><span style="color: black;">In 1884, the Lawn Club secured “the use of a large tract of land owned by Colonel Frank Fellows just north of Sachem Street” (24). According to Sanborn Maps and other maps, no buildings were on the property when the Lawn Club began their activities (25). In 1891, the group organized the New Haven Lawn Company which purchased several cities lots from the Fellows family (26). To accommodate its growing membership, the Lawn Club purchased a 40’ by 109’ lot running west from Orange Street in 1912 (27). Finally, in order to head off possible street extensions from the east (Pearl Street) and the south (Lincoln Street) two additional lots were added in 1920 and 1923 to reach its current size of 6.38 acres (28).</span></p>','<p><span style="color: black;">(1) National Park Services. </span><em style="color: black;">National Register of Historic Places Collection.

Its neoclassical columns on all three visible sides and all-white exterior make it stand out in a streetscape populated by multi-family houses not in the same style or color. Though seemingly pristine when viewed briefly from the street, its deterioration is apparent upon closer inspection, likely due to both weathering and age. The wings on either side of the building were additions made in the middle of the last century. This building has always been a place of worship, and currently houses a Seventh-Day Adventist church.&nbsp;</p>','<p>1<sup>st</sup> Church of Christian Scientists (1910-1950)</p><p>Bikur Cholim Sheveth Achim (1953-1994)</p><p>Omega Seventh-Day Adventist Church (1994-present)</p>','<p>This grand, one-story building is a wood structure with a brick base. It is surrounded on 3 sides by massive columns, which conjure up images of the great temples and meeting spaces of Greece and Rome. There is a window directly above the main entrance which has an ornate metal structure covering it, vaguely reminiscent of a compass. There have been additions to each side of the building, clearly noticed because of their lack of grandeur. These additions are made of concrete blocks, which are brick-faced. Everything but the brick base and the gray doors to the wings is painted white, though the paint is starting to crack, chip, and discolor in some areas. There is a wheelchair ramp on the right side of the building constructed out of wood. On the left side of the building one column looks to be falling out of place, as there is rope tying it to the other columns and visible damage both to the top and bottom of the column itself.&nbsp;</p>','<p>The church sits at the corner of its lot, facing the nexus of Monitor Square, Derby Avenue, and Winthrop Avenue, and commanding the residential area in which it is placed due to its sheer size and color. Monitor Square is directly across the street and likely is filled with parents and children after service, provided the weather is nice. Though the sidewalks are not clearly new, they are not falling into disrepair and can still be easily used by members of the community. Derby Avenue is a main thoroughfare to Westville, but it does not seem busy enough to cause a noticeable disturbance. Though Chapel Street and Derby Avenue have a few small shops here and there, this area is primarily made up of multi-family houses. However, directly next to the church and on the opposing corner are large apartment buildings that seem to threaten the peaceful neighborhood.</p>','<p>	This building has served as a place of worship for a few denominations throughout its existence. With the dense conglomeration of houses in the Edgewood and West River neighborhoods just west of downtown, it likely became necessary for the inhabitants of these areas to found places of worship of their own instead of constantly traveling to the center of the city. In the 1911 New Haven Atlas, it looks like the First Church of Christian Scientists and the Plymouth Congregational Church were the only places of worship in these neighborhoods west of downtown (9). The Plymouth Congregational Church was founded first, so perhaps the First Church of Christian Scientists was formed due to overflow of Plymouth, or perhaps in opposition to the church’s teachings. Whatever its initial purpose, the First Church of Christian Scientists occupied the building from its construction in 1910 until 1950 (4). The reason for their departure is unknown, but physical degradation is hinted at in the next tenant’s explanation of their occupation of the building: in the process of moving, they took up an interim location until their “present premises were ready for occupancy” (3). Considering that the next tenant, a Jewish Orthodox Synagogue by the name of Bikur Cholim Sheveth Achim bought the property in 1950 and did not appear in the city directory until 1953, need for physical repairs may be a plausible reason for the former tenant’s move and the 2-year vacancy (3 and 4). </p><p>	The new congregation was formed from two existing synagogues in the New Haven area – Bikur Cholim and Sheveth Achim – and deemed necessary for both groups because of their decline in numbers, lack of funds, dislocations, and changes in immigrant laws (likely a reference to the Immigration Act of 1924, which restricted immigration of Jewish people) (3). Between 1954 and 1955 the synagogue purchased 57 Derby, the land immediately to the left of the building, and either rebuilt or repurposed it into a school. Though the Park family lived in 57 Derby for many years beforehand, the man who was presumably its patriarch died in 1952, leaving his widow and son, who was a cook at Yale, in the house by themselves. The family likely needed money after Mr. Park’s death, and it was convenient timing that the synagogue was also looking to expand its building space. 57 Derby was officially considered the Bikur Cholim Seveth Achim Hebrew School starting in 1955 and the address disappeared from the city directory altogether in 1981, when it was probably formally incorporated with 278 Winthrop (4). </p><p>The synagogue sold the building to the Northeastern Conference of Seventh-Day Adventists in September of 1994. The Seventh Day Adventists have occupied the church to the present day under the name Omega Seventh-Day Adventist Church.&nbsp;</p>','<p>This building was the first on its site since it was an empty lot in 1901 (6). From 1911 to 1924 it appears there was an addition to the rear of the building to take up the remaining space in the back of the land plot. The Bikur Cholim Sheveth Achim synagogue purchased the property directly to the left of the building, 57 Derby, between 1954 and 1955, so the land plot grew, and wings were added to the left and right of the building (4 and 8). The parking lot likely also developed during this time, currently occupying the space between the main building and its left wing. The building has been surrounded by single-family homes and small shops since its existence (6, 7, 8, 9), but there is a concern from the current congregation about the spread of urbanism in the area. The area is far enough west to have been spared the high-rises and gentrified stores of places further east on Chapel Street, but there are two apartment buildings directly near the church that threaten the continuity of the quiet residential neighborhood. The current congregation is seeking to obtain historic status to protect the building from being demolished for development.&nbsp;</p>','<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;City of New Haven, New Haven Neighborhoods Map. <a href="https://newhavenct.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Minimalist/index.html?appid=4db0c188c19845ee92a56da9dcf36446" target="_blank">https://newhavenct.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Minimalist/index.html?appid=4db0c188c19845ee92a56da9dcf36446</a> </p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;City of New Haven, 278 Winthrop Av.

Across from the Smilow Center stands the Connecticut Medical Health Center. Several wings of the Yale New Haven Hospital as well as a research center extend over neighboring lots. The Center is the most recent facility in this medical complex to have been built and aims to serve as a more compact manner of treating cancer within the Yale New Haven Hospital<a href="about:blank" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[1]</a>. The outward impression of the area is that of modern facilities, with little traffic, conveying both modernity and efficiency (Figure 4).</p><p><br></p><p>  <a href="about:blank" target="_blank">[1]</a> High Profile. Smilow Cancer Hospital Completed – Designed by Shepley Bulfinch. https://www.high-profile.com/smilow-cancer-hospital-completed-designed-by-shepley-bulfinch/</p>','<p>Although the most recent addition to the Yale New Haven Hospital, the Smilow Cancer Center is part of a great expansion of medical services, research and education efforts that have started in the early years of the 19<sup>th</sup> century<a href="about:blank" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[1]</a>. The first hospital to open in New Haven was also the United States’ fifth general Hospital. The building opened to the public in 1833 as mainly a charity organization. The project itself took a long time to come to fruition, given the small size of the town of New Haven and its implicit difficulties in gathering the funds necessary to open a hospital. It was built on the plot of land bordered by Cedar Street and Howard Avenue – the lot right next to the future location of the Smilow Center (Figure 6)<a href="about:blank" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[2]</a>. Post-Civil War America saw a growth in hospitals that was reflected in the rapid expansion of the New Haven Hospital towards the end of the 19th century<a href="about:blank" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[3]</a>. In 1889, Grace Hospital, a separate homeopathic medical institution was founded<a href="about:blank" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[4]</a>. Later, in 1945, Grace Hospital would merge with New Haven Hospital to form the Grace New Haven Hospital, which subsequently would become Yale-New Haven Hospital in 1965<a href="about:blank" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[5]</a>. Over the years, the hospital would see many firsts, from the first artificial heart pump in the United States to the first intensive care unit for newborns<a href="about:blank" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[6]</a>. Within this historical context of medical progress and excellency evident at Yale New Haven Hospital, Smilow Cancer Hospital seems a natural step towards striving for the same kind of excellence in oncological treatment.</p><p><br></p><p>  <a href="about:blank" target="_blank">[1]</a> New Haven’s Hospitals.

The 1901 Sanborn Fire Insurance Map as well as the 1923 Sanborn Fire Insurance Map show that on the original lot situated between Davenport Avenue, Howard Avenue and Park Street resided a St. John’s Catholic Church and St. John’s Catholic School (Figure 5). The church was built in 1858 and the lot surrounding it was used as a cemetery as well<a href="about:blank" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[1]</a>. During the construction of the Smilow Center the unnamed graves were uncovered and their discovery halted the construction of the project for a short while<a href="about:blank" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[2]</a>. According to the Archdiocese of New Haven, the property was bought by Yale New Haven Hospital in 1969<a href="about:blank" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[3]</a>. The 1973 Sanborn Fire Insurance Map confirms this as by 1973 the lot is only occupied by a new, Yale School of Nursing building (Figure 6). The lot continued to be developed by Yale New Haven Hospital, with the hospital extending between South Frontage Road, Park Street, Howard Avenue and York Street (Figure 7)<a href="about:blank" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[4]</a>. In 2005, Yale New Haven Hospital was scheduled to demolish the Grace Building to make room for the Smilow Center; however this was delayed by disagreements with city officials. Construction only began in 2006, finishing in 2010<a href="about:blank" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[5]</a>.</p><p><br></p><p>  <a href="about:blank" target="_blank">[1]</a> Archdiocese of Hartford.

Built in 1910, the Tomb is a neoclassical-style society hall that houses one of Yale’s eminent secret societies, Berzelius. Largely bereft, apart from its crowning ornamentation at the top, bottom, and entrance, the Tomb is architecturally as well as physically distanced from its urban landscape. The Tomb’s physically imposing structure that stands removed from its urban context paired with a dearth of concrete information on its social history creates a mysterious allure for the casual observer and the scholar alike.&nbsp;</p>','<p>1910 – Present: Berzelius Society</p>','<p>The Berzelius Society Tomb, a large and imposing society hall, is primarily constructed of Indiana limestone blocks, supported by steel girders (1). The limestone blocks that compose a majority of the building’s façade create a blankness that dominates the physical appearance of the structure. The limestone block face is only disrupted by six windows on each side, two metal doors at the front entrance, and ornamentation at the very top, bottom, and around the doors. This eclectic yet minimal collection of ornamentation and iron-clad windows on the otherwise blank surface of limestone provide the street observer with minimal material with which to identify the building’s purpose or origin, enhancing the mystery around the Tomb.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Each window is covered with iron detailing which prevents anyone from looking in and emphasizes the secrecy of the building. The three front windows on the left-hand side are staggered, as opposed to the front four windows on the right-side, which are in a square formation. This difference suggests the presence of a staircase on the left side of the building with a half floor landing between the first and second floor.</p><p><br></p><p>At the top of the Tomb, oriental, Asian-inspired detailing is paired with a Greek revival cornice banding. The building is crowned with a cornice line balustrade. These elements span the entire top edge of the building, uninterrupted by the building’s various obtrusions and protrusions. The large, ornate metal entrance doors are framed by a similarly eclectic mix of ornamentation, predominantly of the late Renaissance and Baroque style. At the bottom of the building runs a more circular ornamentation banding. </p><p><br></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>At first glance, the building plan appears to be shaped like a T, and early documents describing the Tomb’s construction corroborate this T shape layout (2). However, a closer look at the building reveals a slight protrusion at the top of the T, suggesting a pseudo cross-like plan more typical of churches, suggesting the building is a sacred place. However, the removal of the agency of the top of the cross can be seen as removing the religious component, and instead emphasizing the society itself as the sacred entity. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The main entrance to the building is flat and superimposed onto the south side of the building, as opposed to a grand entrance that might be expected of such a grand building. There is no threshold beyond the five steps up to the two ornate metals doors with which to offer a sense of welcome visitors. A curved inset in the gate is all that loosely suggests one can enter. By creating such an unwelcoming front entrance, the Tomb emphasizes the visitors are not welcome. Both the interior layout and the exact nature of what occurs within remains secret to those who are not members of the society.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>','<p>The Berzelius Society Tomb is set off from its larger urban context largely due to its location at the tip of the triangle created by the busy intersection of Whitney, Trumbull and Temple streets. Today, the Tomb is surrounded by a commercial district composed of small storefronts and Yale administrative buildings, though the building is oriented away from these buildings and instead faces a small park, Phelps Triangle.</p><p><br></p><p>Historically, the urban setting surrounding the Tomb was much quieter –&nbsp;composed mostly of houses, at least through the 1920s. However, by 1973, the district had shifted from residential to the commercial hub it has become today (3, 4, 5, 6). </p><p><br></p><p>Both then and now, the physical separation paired with the Tomb’s monumental appearance which contrasts starkly with its surroundings emphasizes the separation the Tomb and its society members from the urban context.&nbsp;</p>','<p><u style="color: black;">&nbsp;</u></p><p>The Berzelius Society Tomb has remained under the uninterrupted ownership of Berzelius Trust Association for the last century since the purchase of the plot, and subsequent construction of the society hall, in 1910<em> </em>(2, 7, 8)<em>. </em>Since its construction, the Tomb has been used by current members and alumni of the Berzelius Society as a meeting hall and gathering space. Originally one of the early Sheffield Societies at Yale, founded in 1848, Berzelius is now one of Yale’s oldest secret societies (1, 2, 12). </p><p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p><p>Consistent with the secrecy inherent to Yale’s secret societies, the Berzelius Trust Association legally changed their name to the Colony Foundation in 1951, presumably under the auspices of disguising the Tomb’s affiliation with Berzelius (9, 10, 11). This secrecy reinforces the separation of the Tomb from those in the surrounding urban setting.<em> </em>Mysterious tombs such as the Berzelius Society Tomb are scattered throughout the New Haven landscape, furthering emphasizing the distance between Yale and its city. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>','<p>In 1910, the Berzelius Trust Association purchased the site from the Hill Estate, Inc. to construct their new tomb (13). While the City Records do not trace the ownership beyond the transfer of land, early maps and photographs reveal that the site previously contained several other structures. Early maps in 1886 and 1888 show that the site was originally divided into two plots: 74 &amp; 78 Trumbull. At 78 Trumbull stood a domestic residence, though the name could not be located. A store with several outbuildings including a shed behind stood on 74 Trumbull (3,16). However, in 1900 either a new house was built, or the old house located at 78 Trumbull was renovated, and the store at 74 Trumbull was razed. The house as of 1901 was built in the Colonial style, with Greek-style elements surrounding the entrance (14, 15, 4). That house would remain standing until the Hill Estate sold the property to the Berzelius Trust Association.&nbsp;</p>','<p><span style="color: black;">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;Building Permit Application, No. 3842, (New Haven: Records of the New Haven Building Inspector), 1910. </span></p><p><span style="color: black;">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Report of the Information Committee for 1909-1910, Berzelius Society, Pamphlets of the Berzelius Society (New Haven: Yale University Manuscripts and Archives). &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: black;">(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;Sanborn Map Company of New York, Insurance Maps of New Haven, Connecticut, vol. 1, 15, 1886.

A Yale alum with a focus on campus ministry, Riggs’s goal was to encourage Catholic worship at Yale, while increasing the Catholic population of students. For years he lobbied the Archdiocese of Hartford for permission to erect a Chapel on campus that would fully allow him to achieve his original goals (1). Finally, in 1935, he was granted this charter, and the history of Saint Thomas More Chapel began (1). Campaigning to raise over $200,000 and working with architect William Douglas (Yale ‘18), Father Riggs paved the way for Catholic students at Yale to worship freely without being criticized for their faith (2,3).</p><p>Over time Saint Thomas More Chapel (STM), completed in 1938 and still standing today, has been renovated and expanded to accommodate the growth of Yale, and specifically the increase in Catholics as a fraction of Yale’s student population (1). In 1959, a renovation costing around $178,000 added a north wing with meeting rooms and a rectory onto the Chapel, creating a place for Chaplains to reside and be more accessible to students (4).</p><p>In 1997, the Board of Trustees and current Chaplain Father Robert Beloin began a campaign to open a student center connected to the Chapel that could support the increase in student involvement at STM (5). The Golden Center, a $25 million building that resulted from campaign, opened in 2006, was designed by architect Cesar Pelli who has completed many projects on Yale’s campus (6). With glass courtyards allowing natural light to flow into the building, both the exterior and interior design of the building is inviting to students. It is a place to study, socialize, and pray - practices which relate to Father Riggs’s original goals of bringing together Catholic students. The prominent location of the STM Chapel and Golden Center, <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">situated </span>directly across Pierson and Davenport Colleges, allows students to access the building easily from campus and has helped destigmatize the idea of being a Catholic at Yale.</p>','<ol><li>Wilkinson, Virginia.

This collaboration resulted in a red brick Colonial Revival style Chapel with clear-cut glass windows that enclose either side of the nave, emphasizing openness and light (1,8). A series of unsympathetic adjustments to the Chapel during the 1970s and 1980s depreciated the integrity of the building, diminishing aspects of brilliance that the original structure boasted (8). In an effort to restore the Chapel back to its original character, the STM Corporation hired Knight Architecture, a New Haven firm, to complete renovations in 2008 (8). </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">To the left of the Chapel, the new addition of the Golden Center features a more modern style of architecture. The two story building, built of brick and wood, was designed to complement, but not upstage, the Chapel (9). Windows covering the building provide natural light, which beyond creating a warm and inviting atmosphere, allows the building to be open and transparent to the Yale community, one of the project’s initial goals (10). Furthermore, the addition also connects STM to Yale’s campus as the piazza which contains the entrance to the Golden Center was intentionally positioned to line up with the preexisting gates of Pierson College (10). Someone standing on York Street can actually peer through the gates of Pierson and see all the way to the Golden Center on Park Street!</span></p><p><br></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Located on Park Street, the STM Chapel and Golden Center lies in close proximity to the heart of Yale’s campus. Directly across from Davenport and Pierson Colleges, STM is also surrounded by off-campus undergraduate residences and fraternity houses, and is steps away from the heavily frequented Broadway commercial area (as shown in the annotated Google Maps image). Thus, it is a place regularly passed by students, which has fostered an increase in awareness of Catholic life at Yale. </span></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Since 1938 the Chapel has been owned by the Saint Thomas More Corporation. The addition of the rectory in 1959, a project spearheaded by Father Riggs’s successor Father Edwin O\'Brien, provided a place for the Chaplin to reside (4). Following Father O’Brien, who lived in the rectory until 1960, Father </span><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">James Healey, Father Richard Russell, Father Michael Gosselin, Father David Baranowski, and Father Robert Beloin (the current Chaplain) have also taken up residence at STM (7).&nbsp;These Chaplains have worked to increase the awareness of Catholicism both in the Yale and New Haven communities.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">The most important role this building as played over the past eighty years has been providing a place for Catholics at Yale to worship freely without feeling condemned. This original goal of Father Riggs has been supported since his death by the STM Corporation who has funded multiple renovations and additions to the Chapel in order to serve the increasing Catholic population at Yale. It is likely that this increase in Catholic students is directly correlated to the presence of a Chapel and student center on campus, as Megan Roberts (Yale ‘21) stated, “I wasn’t sure if Yale was the school for me, but attending a Mass at STM and seeing the Catholic community there convinced me that [Yale] was where I was meant to be” (15). </span></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">While the STM Chapel has stood on 268 Park Street since 1938, the Sanborn Maps and earlier maps of New Haven provide a history of the site prior to the construction of the Chapel. A map of New Haven in 1824 shows that the block bordered by Howe Street and York Street has not been divided, so Park Street does not yet exist (see image, 11). It is sometime between 1824 and 1830 that Park Street is first created, as it is present in the 1830 New Haven map by surveyor D.W. Buckingham (see image, 12). While the 1830 map does not depict any buildings on Park, a map in 1847 shows the street</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"> </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">to be lined with buildings (presumably residences and small shops), providing a foundation for STM’s site history (see image, 12,13). </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Beginning with 1886, the Sanborn Maps provide details about the specific type of buildings that occupied the property prior to the Chapel and Golden Center. In 1886, the site contained a few dwellings and both Seabrook &amp; Smith and D. Tobin Carriage Companies, as in the late 19th century New Haven was the center of America’s carriage industry (see Sanborn Map of 1886, 14). The rise of automobiles in the early 20th century led to the rapid decline of carriage companies, and these buildings were soon replaced by an auto repair store and White City Candy Company, another popular New Haven industry at the time (see Sanborn Map of 1924). By 1937, these buildings and residences had been demolished to allow for the construction of the Chapel (see images). </span></p>');

It is a brick, Beaux-Arts classical style building with stone details sitting in New Haven’s Ninth Square. The building originally served as a fire station from 1905-1961, and it was renovated between 2002 and 2005 into its current use as a restaurant, bar, state-of-the-art music recording studio/concert venue, and loft living space. A more recent renovation included the addition of a three bedroom apartment, added to the roof of the building and available for rent on AirBnB. The renovations of this building were part of the city’s attempt to revitalize the Ninth Square.</p>','<p>New Haven Fire Department (Engine 12): 1905-1961</p>','<p>This large brick building originally was two floors plus a basement, and it has two large cut-outs in the front, which originally served as doors for fire trucks. Many aspects of the façade are indicators of the Beaux-Arts style, including the flat roof, the arches above the doors, and the stone decorations (two framing the windows, the decoration on the roof, and the faux columns between the windows) (1).&nbsp;Now, the building has been restored and modernized, with large wooden doors and windows replacing the fire truck doors. The first set of renovations took place between 2002 and 2005 and were led by the firm Gray Organschi, whose offices are next door (2). The entrance leads either down to the cocktail room in the basement or to the state-of-the-art recording studio and concert space on the main floor. The second floor is split between a sitting room/office space and a large, high-ceilinged loft with two bedrooms. The new addition of the top floor (added atop the old roof) is a three bedroom apartment. There are two furnished rooftops, one off the second floor facing the back parking lot and the second at the top of the building accessible to tenants of the apartment. Original features of the building, including window shutters, an old medal hay hook hanging from the ceiling, and the original structural beams and bricks, can be seen throughout the building, but windows have been replaced and there is a clean line of separation between the original brick of the firehouse and the light-colored cross-laminated timber panels of the added apartment (3).&nbsp;</p>','<p>Firehouse 12 is in the middle of new Haven’s Ninth Square, a commercial district that has been improved and redeveloped over the last thirty years. This has always been a more commercial, previously manufacturing-oriented part of the city, as seen in Sanborn maps dating back to 1886 (4) and now the building is surrounded by businesses, including restaurants, cafes, and small retailers, as well as lots of parking space.&nbsp;</p>','<p>The New Haven Department of Fire Service - No. 12 occupied 47 Crown St. for over 55 years (1905-1961), serving the Ninth Square District and beyond. The fire engines (at this time these were horses pulling water or trucks powered by steam) occupied the first floor, and the second floor was the hayloft for the horses (2). After the department was disbanded, the building remained vacant (3) for over 40 years. During this time, as with other vacant buildings in the area, the building became home to many squatters, and it began to fall apart with age and misuse. </p><p>The Ninth Square District went through a season of urban renewal in the 1980s-early 2000s to restore vacant buildings and encourage more foot traffic in the area (6). The success of the project has increased commerce in the area, with 94% of retail spaces leased as of 2016, and the cleaned-up district has become popular among artists and people of varied incomes (6). Firehouse 12 was one of these revamped vacant buildings, and the city sought proposals in 2002 for its reuse. Nick Lloyd and Megan Craig submitted a plan to restore the building (now labeled as 45 Crown St.) into the musician’s haven that it is today, and renovations were finished in 2005 (7). Because of the city’s conditions for sale, the owners also had to live in the building for seven years, so a large loft was built as their new home (3). &nbsp;</p><p>Firehouse 12 has seen success as a bar and restaurant, winning many accolades for best bartender in New Haven (8). The state-of-the-art recording studio was designed by John Storyk, who also designed Jimmy Hendrix’s Electric Lady Studios (9), and its record label fits a niche audience and set of performers in experimental jazz. Outside of the jazz world, the studio has also been used for recording audio books and a cappella groups from the nearby Yale University (10). The studio also serves as a performance venue, and it hosts a spring and fall jazz festival every year (9). The upstairs living space was converted into a loft for rent (usually to musicians playing or recording at the studio) after the required seven years’ of residence by the owners was complete. The addition of the top floor (an architectural feat in which 10 pieces made of cross-laminated timber panels were attached to and assembled on the roof in just one day) expanded the rentable space to include 3 more bedrooms (2), all with access to a stunning roof-top view of downtown New Haven.</p><p>Overall, Firehouse 12 is a great example of a Ninth Square urban renewal success story, and it serves as an inspiration both for other businesses downtown and for aspiring architects at Yale and beyond.</p>','<p>Originally, this plot was partially occupied by a shed, which is seen on Sanborn insurance maps of 1886 and 1901 (4, 5). The construction of the fire station was completed in 1905, and “Fire Dep’t. Eng. Co. No. 12” makes its first appearance on the 1923 Sanborn map (11). This building is unlabeled in the 1973 Sanborn map, after the department was disbanded (12). Since then, renovations were completed in 2005 to revitalize the building and 2016 for the addition of the apartments (3).</p>','<p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;Craven, Jackie. "What\'s So Fine About Beaux Arts?"

Haight','4','<p>	Through its long history, Sloane Physics Laboratory has developed into a prominent center for physics research within the United States, boasting 10 Nobel Prizes in Physics and the largest particle accelerator available for the use of undergraduate students (1, 2). Today, it continues to house Yale University’s Department of Physics and provides space for the hundreds of students and researchers that work in this building on a daily basis.</p><p>	However, while it can be easily inferred through its ornamentation that this was at one time an impressive building, this gothic revival style building made of brown stone masonry with reinforced concrete is noticeably deteriorating. It additionally stands aside newer and taller buildings, taking away from its grandeur. With extremely cluttered lab spaces in the underground floors and limited classroom space in the upstairs, the building is threatened by the changing needs of an expanding university. While the classrooms continue to be renovated, implying they will continue to be used in the near future, greater demand for state-of-the-art laboratories has forced the university to move many of the physics teaching labs into the nearby buildings (3, 4). Additionally, with the construction of a brand new laboratory building within a few yards from the entrance of Sloane, rumors within the Physics department suggest that many of the researchers and faculty offices will be moved as well, leading to a drastic change in the use of this historic building (4, 5).</p>','75,584 sq ft gross area, 64000 sq ft living space','<p>Sheffield Scientific School (1912-1945)</p>','<p>	Sloane Physics Laboratory is a 3-story gothic revival style building with two underground floors. Its rectangular shape, brown stone masonry exterior and turret tower gives it a heavy and squat appearance despite its use of gothic revival forms, a style of building that is generally associated with structures that draw the eyes upwards towards the heavens (6). It instead focuses on ornamentation with lancet windows, arched entryway frames, many gables in the roof to create the points that resemble conventional gothic forms. Many universities built around this era also adopted this form of gothic architecture, leading to the style of collegiate gothic. Due to the style’s associations with morality and enlightenment, this was purposely done in order to add to the social and cultural importance of these institutions (6).</p><p>	On the interior, terrazzo floors, arched entryways, tall, lancet windows, and barrel and groin vaulted ceilings add to the grandeur of the building, especially within the beautiful atrium between the first and second floors. However, the exposed concrete, rusted water pipes, and cracked floors reveal signs of deterioration. These features are among the many that have stayed nearly the same since the inception of the building, save for the changes made to keep in line with new fire codes throughout the years (4). The only parts of the building that have recently undergone renovation are the classrooms on the first and second floor, which are notably the only rooms within the building that now have air condition systems (3).</p>','<p>	Sloane Physics Laboratory is surrounded by other laboratory and classroom buildings owned by Yale University. Together, this complex of buildings is known as Yale’s Science Hill, and is thus very busy and constantly occupied by student pedestrians. The plot of land has been under construction for a majority of the past decade and tends to be very loud.</p><p>	The land lies north of the center of the university, and many of the streets that lead up to the plot feature Italianate houses, formerly owned by upper middle class New Haven citizens, that have since been renovated into classrooms or administrative buildings (7). The streets are lined with lush trees and continue to appear residential despite their new use.</p><p>	Further north, there are many Second Empire style houses that are part of the wealthy residential neighborhood of Prospect Hill (8).</p>','<p>	Yale University has continued to hold incredible prestige as an educational institution since its inception in 1701. However, for nearly two centuries, the university focused on a curriculum almost entirely in the arts and humanities. It was, at the time, believed that scientific instruction was far too vocational for the enlightening Yale course program (9). This, however, led to much controversy towards the 20<sup>th</sup> century, especially as other forward-thinking universities such as Harvard began to incorporate sciences into its curriculum. Due to competition pressures, Yale University thus began to expand to include the sciences. However, in keeping with its original philosophy, it began by building laboratories and classrooms away from the center of campus despite the availability of space within Yale’s Old Campus, the original center of the university (9). Sloane was first placed on Library Street but has since been moved northwards, towards the wealthy Prospect and Hillhouse neighborhoods. While Sloane Physics Laboratory was the first of the buildings in what will later be known as Yale’s “Science Hill”, many came about soon after including the Osborne Zoology Laboratory, Sage Hall, and Sterling Chemistry Laboratory (9).</p><p>	In 1847, the Sheffield Scientific School, specializing in the instruction of engineering and natural sciences, was founded on Prospect Street as a supplement to Yale’s curriculum (10). In its early years, a large divide existed between the students of the two schools despite both being under the same corporation. However, due to the wealth and resources of the University, students and faculty in the Sheff School were allowed to use Yale buildings for instruction. Thus, while buildings including Sloane Physics Lab were commissioned for Yale, its classrooms and laboratories were originally occupied mainly by students and faculty of the Sheff School (11). In fact, the first director of the Sloane Physics Laboratory was Henry A. Bumstead, a professor of physics at the Sheff School (12). Since then, the two schools have merged as instruction in the sciences has become more prominent.</p><p>	Today, Yale’s Science Hill has developed into a prominent center for research and innovation. Despite the University’s start as an institution for education in the humanities, it has recently vowed to devote $500 million in resources to raise the profile of sciences at Yale. Of this money, $300 million is set to go to renovations of existing facilities and $200 million is set to go to five entirely new buildings (13).</p><p>In the physics department in particular, this development is extremely evident. Currently, the department houses over 50 faculty members, over 50 research staff, and over 100 graduate students in addition to the hundreds of Yale College undergraduates enrolled in physics courses (14). The department has additionally taken an integral role Yale’s recent promise to increase diversity by housing annual events such as the American Physics Society Conference for Undergraduate Women in Physics and the Edward Bouchet Conference, the latter being named after a physics student at Yale who became the first African American to earn a doctorate degree at any American university (15).</p>','<p>	The plot of land now known as Yale University’s “Science Hill” began as the property known as Sachem’s Wood. Located within the Hillhouse Avenue and Prospect Hill Historical Districts, this plot of land is nested inside the wealthiest neighborhoods in New Haven. It lies at the edge of the Prospect District, which developed between 1880 and 1930 as a residential neighborhood for upper middle class business leaders and educators (7). Featuring Victorian stick style houses, some with rich, Second Empire ornamentation, these houses continue to be occupied by families of similar socioeconomic status as the original inhabitants, notably the families of many Yale University deans, professors, alumni, and staff members (7).</p><p>	On the other side of the property, the Hillhouse Avenue District was established by James Hillhouse, a former senator and representative of Connecticut, in the hopes of creating a fashionable residential development<sup> </sup>(8). Upon the construction of the Farmington Canal, a waterway that traversed the region on it way to its outlet in the New Haven Harbor, increased economic optimism among New Haven’s upper class residents led to the commission of multiple homes along the district (8). The most important influence for the architecture style of the neighborhood came from James Hillhouse himself, as his family mansion at the top of the hill, on Sachem’s Wood where Sloane Physics Lab lies today, became a standard for these commissions. The form of his original Greek revival villa atop the park-like grounds of the site was repeated in the Hellenic and Italianate houses that continue to line the district (8).</p><p>	While this mansion dominated the neighborhood for decades, a donation by Mrs. Russell Sage, a descendent of Hillhouse, transferred ownership of Sachem’s Wood to Yale University in 1910, at a time when Yale began looking to expand its curriculum to the sciences. This led to the nesting of Science Hill within the wealthy residential neighborhoods (16).</p>','<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“List of Nobel laureates by university affiliation,” Wikipedia, accessed February 26, 2018 </p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="background-color: white; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Swerdlow Joshua, Yale Undergraduate Physics Major.

Accessed February 23, 2018. http://walknewhaven.org/tours/map_sites/lowerdixwell_history.html.</p>','<p>This church is positioned on the western side of Dixwell Avenue in a peaceful, but yet highly contested neighborhood with consistent motor transportation accompanying it. Along the street are residential buildings that have similar design to the church with occasional commercial buildings along the way. There is a healthy mix of a neighborhood and commercial feel that allows both aspects to be prevalent. Most buildings have a well-maintained appearance and the surrounding area seems to be in decent shape.</p>','<p>This one-story building that resembles the epitome of Gothic Revival style has an exterior primarily composed of brick and aluminum siding.<a href="https://nhba.yale.edu/admin/form?buildingId=5a920fbb2fd33b23286c5c79#_ftn1" target="_blank">[1]</a> Uncommon for churches built after the mid-19th century, St. Matthews Union Free Will was remarkably built with just a wood frame structure.<a href="https://nhba.yale.edu/admin/form?buildingId=5a920fbb2fd33b23286c5c79#_ftn2" target="_blank">[2]</a> The entrance of the church faces directly to a sidewalk on Dixwell Avenue and hoists a very large set of stairs that seems to depict its massive size albeit being just one story high. The first thing that will catch your eye is a massive lancet window, known for its common expression in Gothic architecture, which is located directly over the main entrance.<a href="https://nhba.yale.edu/admin/form?buildingId=5a920fbb2fd33b23286c5c79#_ftn3" target="_blank">[3]</a> This window sits under a large gable roof that seems to focus attention directly on the center-piece features of the lancet window. The sides of the building contain the same style windows and the rest of the building is protected by a dark fence. The building has multiple gable-style roofs that flatten and form multiple ridges along its various sides, and on the top of the building is a castle-like structure with lancet-arched windows that seem to be translucent to light. Notable to mention is the fact that this building was originally built in 1915, but not until 1980 was it renovated to add its brick addition and various features that make it so unique.</p>','<p>Originally built in 1915 by architect Alfred L. Johnson, the building has a very interesting story surrounding it. The original intention to start a church was when, according to the church’s website, “a group of Blacks met in a home on Orchard Street with an intention to spread Christian fellowship of their culture”<a href="#_ftn1" target="_blank">[4]</a>. This group migrated to multiple locations until it decided to purchase this building in 1960. At the time, this building had different owners and was named “Olivet Baptist Church” until St. Matthew’s purchased it under Rev. Dr. Lloyd Taylor. Officially renamed to St. Matthews Unison Free Will Baptist Church, Rev. Dr. Lloyd Taylor would go on to serve as pastor until his death on June 29, 1977. Three years after his death, the building had an immense addition that added a large portion of its extraordinary brick exterior that we see today. Currently lying on the outskirts of a town that thrives on its commercial properties and population density, St. Matthews Unison Free Will is open to all residents and hosts daily worship and teaching services. Its current pastor is Elder Kevin C. Hardy, who is serving as the church’s ninth pastor. Overall, this church seemed to have a larger social impact than we can tangibly identify in the present day. In the past, specifically periods around the 1850’s when blacks first migrated to houses near lower Dixwell Avenue in larger numbers, churches played a major role in assimilation and socialization of new members.<a href="#_ftn2" target="_blank">[5]</a> This church, specifically, was built on the premises of expanding religious beliefs to an area that lacked their cultural representation, and this fact alone should prove its long-lasting significance to the New Haven community.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>','<p>Before being built in 1915 as the Olivet Baptist Church, this land seems to have been owned publically. According to Sanborn maps of 1911, there was no building at the location of 400 Dixwell Ave at that time, but a large portion of the surrounding homes on the street were owned by a family with the last name “Hawley”. In the years after the Great Depression that sent Dixwell Ave productivity into a significant decline, New Haven began a redevelopment and renewal program which focused on bringing lower Dixwell into better residential and commercial standards, around the time when St. Matthews Union Free Will Baptist Church purchased Olivet Baptist Church to begin its services.<a href="#_ftn1" target="_blank">[6]</a> The church has remained open since its original purchase with consistent excellent reviews over the years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>');

For most of its history, it was an office building with a bank on the ground floor, but in 2014, the offices were converted to apartments, and the building was renamed The Union. A bank still occupies the ground floor, but now it is Wells Fargo instead of the Union and New Haven Trust Company. The Union and New Haven Trust Building was a central component of the consolidation of New Haven’s modern office district downtown and remains a stately emblem of the Colonial Revival style of the Roaring Twenties.&nbsp;</p>','13','106\' x 165\'','<p>The Union and New Haven Trust Building is a 13-story brick building of the Colonial Revival style (1). The exterior is in excellent condition due to recent restoration work. The narrow facade of the building, set on the street corner (2), soars several stories above the broader lateral faces and culminates with a cupola, reflecting the one that tops the United Church, located across from the Union on the New Haven Green (1). Although the building is immense, architects Cross &amp; Cross incorporated design elements to honor New Haven’s Federal Green, describing it as a tower “of pure Colonial design” that possessed “refinements of appropriateness” (1). The Colonial Revival design is in harmony with the library of the same style on the north side of the Green (2). The Union’s cupola is topped by a golden dome, which is illuminated red at night, and is an icon of the Elm City’s lively and historic downtown.</p>','<p>The Union and New Haven Trust Building is located on the corner of Church and Elm Streets, where there are nearly always pedestrians gathered on the sidewalk, gazing across at the Green while waiting to cross the busy intersection. The building’s facade, now the entrance to Wells Fargo, has been constructed on the street corner such that the building faces the New Haven Green diagonally (2), giving it a strong presence at the edge of this urban hub. The building is located downtown, in the midst of a bustling commercial area with high building density (2). It is surrounded by government buildings, offices, and banks. In addition to the Wells Fargo that shares building, there is Citizens Bank, KeyBank, New Alliance Bank, the law firm Harris Beach, and New Haven City Hall. Behind the Union and New Haven Trust Building is the 59 Elm Street parking lot.</p>','<p>The New Haven Green and surrounding buildings looked like a typical New England town until around the time of World War I, with the emergence of the Taft Hotel, the library, post office, and courthouse, all of which contributed to a more modern, urban style (3). Around the same time, however, there was a strong pull to return New Haven to its traditional appearance, which led to the Colonial Revival era of the 1920s, which the Union and New Haven Trust Building magnificently exemplified. When the building was completed in 1928, the Roaring Twenties had yet to see their demise: The stock market would crash in October of the following year (4). Another paradigm of this style was the New Haven Colony Historical Society on Whitney Avenue, built 1929, which even featured a cupola like the Union building (1). Yale was in the process of building several new residential colleges, including Pierson College, also Colonial Revival, in 1930 (5). In 1928 New Haven’s banks and business leaders founded a philanthropic organization, the Community Foundation of Greater New Haven, which still exists today (6). In&nbsp;May 1929, across the street from the new building, the city erected the World War Memorial and Flagstaff on the New Haven Green, near the place where the first Liberty Pole stood before the American Revolution (6). In doing so, they tied the city’s memory of World War I to its revolutionary spirit. Perhaps Colonial Revivalism was a visual manifestation of a deeper undercurrent of nationalism, which was prevalent in many city institutions. New Haven in the 1920s had a large immigrant population, and as in many American cities at the time, there was a drive to “Americanize” the newcomers, especially through assimilation in schools, where children supposedly came to love “the stars and stripes” (7). This nationalistic spirit may have contributed to the return to Colonial architecture.</p><p>Meanwhile, the popularity of the chain store, “with its ‘cut prices,’ standardized merchandise, clever advertising, and uniform, impersonal service,” was dramatically reshaping downtown New Haven (8). On Chapel and Church Streets in the ’20s, where the construction of the Union building was imminent, national chains were rapidly replacing local shops (8). By 1930, chain grocery stores, drugstores, cigar stores, ice cream parlors, hardware stores, and more dominated the area, causing a full-fledged “commercial revolution” (8).</p><p>When the Union and New Haven Trust Building was converted into an apartment complex named The Union in 2014, Mayor Toni Harp said, “We are delighted to see how there’s new life in this cornerstone property, and we treasure what it means beyond all work that has been done here. We recognize how this investment in New Haven signals progress for New Haven. We know the confidence these owners and developers place in New Haven’s future helps to decide New Haven’s future. We’re grateful for their confidence and we’ll keep working every day to earn it all over again” (9).&nbsp;</p>','<p>The Union and New Haven Trust Company building was designed by architects Cross &amp; Cross. It was constructed in 1927 on the site of the Security Insurance Co. building (2). The builder was Ridgeley Larkin, president of the Larkin-Carey Real Estate Company (10).</p><p> In 1969, the Union and New Haven Trust Company became the Union Trust Company in a merger with the Fairfield County Trust Company (this is engraved on a marble plaque on the building’s facade). In 1981, the Union Trust Company relocated its headquarters to Stamford, CT, but kept a branch office on the ground floor of the New Haven location (11). Twelve years later, First Fidelity Bancorporation Inc. and Banco Santander, S.A. acquired Northeast Bancorp, Inc., of which Union Trust Company was a subsidiary (12). Although it changed owners several times, it seems that the building housed a bank and offices continuously until May 2009, when it was sold to Hampshire New Haven (2). Hampshire supposedly evicted the “random collection” of lawyers and businesspeople who had rented the offices (13), and proceeded to refurbish the exterior and interior, attempting to keep the building true to its historic style and to make it more environmentally sustainable (14). Some of the improvements included restoring the cupola, the facade, and the marble railing around the 11th story (14). There was speculation that these new owners were planning to convert part of the building from offices to a luxury hotel (14). By 2013, however, the plans to turn the building into a hotel had still not been accomplished (13). In March of that year, the building was purchased by Cooper Church LLC (15) and ultimately converted into an apartment building, which was renamed The Union. The building is still home to a bank, currently Wells Fargo.</p>','<ol><li>Elizabeth Mills Brown, <em>New Haven: A Guide to Architecture and Urban Design </em>(New Haven, CT: Yale University, 1976), 114. </li><li>Historic Resources Inventory document, c.o.

The three-story Italianate-style house features a Federal Revival porch with Corinthian columns that were added around 1915. Though the house has withstood the test of time, signs of wear and tear are visible in the peeling stucco exterior and general disarray of the backyard. The house forms a polarizing image in the Yale cultural landscape, an image bolstered by photos of the house’s Federal Revival porch and exterior lion statues that frame the porch in Yale Daily News articles chronicling the behavior of some of its members. </span></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This 3-story Italianate townhouse features a Federal Revival porch that was added in 1915. The entry porch is the most commanding feature of the stuccoed facade which otherwise is characterized by symmetrically balanced casement windows, a gabled/hip roof with a slight eave overhang with dentils, and a chimney on the side. The entry porch features a prominent central stone stair, four Corinthian columns, and a small balcony with a wrought iron rail on top of the porch. The entryway is flanked by two stone lion statues that presumably gave rise to the fraternity’s name, LEO. The house’s Italianate exterior and Federal Revival porch along with the&nbsp;lion statues contribute to a feeling of regal prominence that is echoed in the fraternity’s name (which is not actually visible anywhere on the front of the house). The house has a high foundation, and stairs in both the front and back of the house allow basement access. The exteriors in both the front and the backyard show signs of weathering, less so in the front with a few instances of peeling stucco. The piles of trash that tend to pile out front on the weekend contribute to the sense of decay. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In 2012 and 2013, additions were made to the house in order to bring it up to fire code. Detailed architectural plans were commissioned in 2011 in order to design a fire escape staircase that was added to the back of the house in 2012 (see archival documents). In 2013, the building inspector filed a complaint that the deck in the backyard lacked a railing, and so a wooden railing was added that year. </span></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The house sits in a densely packed residential area that borders the Chapel Street commercial district. Though the street is rather peaceful on the weekdays (despite heavy car traffic), the Leo house, along with the adjacent Sigma Nu house and Sigma Phi Epsilon, are commonly frequented by Yale students on the weekends, with lines out the door of each of the three fraternities. Together, they are referred to as the “High Street Frats” or “Frat Row.” </span></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The house at 35 High Street was built in 1840, a time in which New Haven was flourishing as an industrial and manufacturing city, and just after the first railroad to New Haven was completed in 1839. After the end of the Civil War, Yale constructed its “semipublic art building” at the corner of High and Chapel (where the Yale Center for British Art stands today), and the area began to develop into a “Gold Coast” of showy middle class houses and private dormitories for affluent students. The addition of the 1915 Federal Revival porch came at a time of renewed industrial activity in New Haven because of its armory. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Though the immediate block surrounding 35 High has been mostly residential since its construction (the house was constructed around the same time as the houses at both 26 and 38 High Street), the conversion of the three houses that make up “frat row” changed its relationship to its surroundings. The uses of the house will be discussed further in the social history section. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Additionally, city building records seem to indicate some sort of fire damage to the house was incurred around 1991, though the nature and extent of the fire is unclear. </span></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Throughout the history of 35 High Street, the residential style building has functioned as a mostly private yet social space (in different specific uses). For much of the early history of the house, though the property was privately owned, the owners made use of it by renting out furnished rooms. In the 1960s into the early 21st century, the house was the home of the Chabad for Yale’s Hillel, the center for Jewish Campus Life and home to its rabbi. Presently, the house is occupied by Leo, the fraternity formerly known as Sigma Alpha Epsilon, in a continued private function, closed to the public, but open to Yale students and invited guests during party hours on the weekends.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">According to New Haven Museum Library records, the house appears to have been originally owned by Clinton Pettis. The property originally included both 35 and 37 High Street at a single address, 37 High Street. By the printing of the 1886 Sanborn Map, the house that is today 37 High Street was constructed under Pettis’ ownership and rented furnished rooms (likely to Yale students) at both 35 and 37 High Street. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In the late 19th and early 20th century, entries in the Yale Banner (the university yearbook) seem to indicate that the Decagon Club, a Yale Dining Club met at 35 High Street. George Pettis (evidence suggests he is Clinton’s son), was a Yale alumnus, and the use of the building as a dining club while it was still in residential use foreshadows its present fraternity occupants. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">By 1939, the house appears to have been out of the hands of the Pettis family, as the sole residents of the house listed are a Mrs. E. T. Freeman and L. E. Freeman; at this time the Freemans were still offering furnished rooms for rent. In 1955 the house passed into the hands of E. M. Seger, who continued to offer the furnished rooms for rent.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">By the time of entry in the 1961 city directory, the house had been converted into office space, in use by a civil engineer (R S Fisher), an accountant (S J Alderman), and a lawyer (F Rosoff). Though the residential design is uncommon in office programming, the house continued to serve in its historical private/social capacity.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In the mid-60s, the building changed hands yet again. The building served as part of the community building vision for Jewish life at Yale, championed by Rabbi Richard J. Israel. After the end of restrictive quotas that determined how many Jewish students could attend Yale, the number of Jewish students and faculty increased substantially. Responding to this need, Rabbi Israel and the Yale Hillel Board of Trustees launched a campaign to buy 35 and 37 High Street, one to house the rabbi and his family, and the other to house Yale Hillel. The two buildings served the Jewish community in this joint capacity until the Sept. 1995 opening of the Joseph Slifka Center for Jewish Life at Yale, which then housed the previously spread out elements of campus Jewish life.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In May of 1996, the house was sold to the “Connecticut Omega Chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon,” the housing corporation that still owns the house today. Upon their purchase of the house, several elements that identified the fraternity house were added, including the traditional Sigma Alpha Epsilon Greek lettering on the wrought iron railing as well as the tiling of SAE Greek lettering on the kitchen wall. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Part of the reason why the building at 35 High Street persists in Yale’s cultural memory is due to the controversies that surrounded Sigma Alpha Epsilon during its time on campus. SAE as a national organization has been plagued by numerous incidents of racial and sexual misconduct, including two incidents in 2015 — one at the University of Oklahoma in which a video of fraternity brothers singing a racist song on a bus went viral and another of sexual misconduct at Stanford’s chapter. In February of 2015, then Dean of Yale College Jonathan Holloway banned Yale’s chapter of SAE from campus and prohibited them from using the SAE name in connection to Yale, after a University investigation found that the chapter had violated University policies on sexual misconduct. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">However, the February 2015 ban did not prevent more controversy from plaguing the house, which drew national headlines during a heated period of racial unrest on campus in the fall of 2015. During the weekend of Halloween 2015, members of SAE were accused of discrimination; according to allegations, they barred entry into their Halloween party on the basis of race. Interestingly enough, in national coverage of the incident by publications like </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Washington Post</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> and </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Time</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, the publications chose to run generic photos of Yale, not the house at 35 High. In </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Yale Daily News </em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">and campus coverage of the house, images of the house were used. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In May 2016, the fraternity brothers announced they were disaffiliating from the national organization, instead choosing to go by the name “Leo.” In the YDN article that broke this news, a photo of the house at 35 High ran with an American flag draping over the wrought iron railing where the SAE letters hung. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In September 2017, Leo came under scrutiny after a black student at Southern Connecticut State University claimed on Facebook that the brothers turned her and her friends away from a party because of her race. A month later, the YDN broke the news that Leo had still not disaffiliated from the national organization of SAE. The house is still listed as being owned by the Connecticut Omega Chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon (when asked about this, a brother from the organization said that this was due to the nature of the housing corporation as an entity that formed to buy the house). Even though the lion statues still flank the staircase out front and show the fraternity’s current affiliations, remnants of its days as SAE still remain. The tiling in the kitchen still stands. An old piece of plywood with SAE painted on in yellow lettering sits in the backyard. SAE is haphazardly spray painted on both the oven and the refrigerator.

Tenants change every few years, as graduated students leave campus and new students arrive.</p>','<p>This multi-family, 2.5 story home stands tall in very good condition. Passersby will notice its unique style, characterized by its steep gable - styled roof, half-timbered exterior filled with stucco, and multi-colored brick covering the lower half of the house. This brick is quite unconventional, and consists of multiple misshapen, erratically placed stones. These stones could fulfill either a structural or an aesthetic purpose, and could possibly be the result of repairs made to the exterior walls.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Among the brick and timber are the windows. These windows are small, narrow, rectangular, and clustered quite closely together, indicating a dark interior, lacking natural light often associated with tudors. Additionally, many small windows are scattered along the fronts and sides of the home. On the rooftop one can see a classic dormer style window, which allows a small touch of natural light up into the top floor of the building, likely a bedroom as this is a multi-family house, with tenants on each floor.</p>','<p>This building stands alongside many similar sized houses that stretch down Lynwood Place, between Elm St. and Edgewood Ave. The street is quite small, with a narrow road and very little traffic. Although not well known, the street has a terrific personality, as each house is filled with Yale Students and faculty. Many Yale varsity athletic teams have designated houses on Lynwood place, including the Men\'s Lightweight Crew Team and the Sailing team, which stand directly across from 23 Lynwood. These houses, along with 33, 35, and 37 Lynwood, are social hubs of the area. In contrast, 23 serves as a very steady presence on the street, to counterbalance any immaturity or flippancy. It\'s staunch, robust nature and mature tenants provide the backbone to the street, while its aesthetic provides a sense of neighborhood within the city street.&nbsp;</p>','<p>According to the Sanborn Maps, the houses on Lynwood Place were erected right near New Haven’s Seabrook Smith &amp; Co. carriage factory. These houses likely served as residences for the workers in this factory, allowed quick commutes and served as social hubs after the end of the workday. As the rise of the automobile took hold of America, Seabrook Smith &amp; Co. failed to change with the times, and ended up dissolving in 1908. After this dissolution, the homes on Lynwood Place likely switched to traditional family housing during the remainder of the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. As Yale’s population expanded throughout the middle/later part of the century, and on-campus housing became more scarce, it is likely that these homes were bought by corporations and rented out to students looking for housing during the school year. This is the function that it still serves today.&nbsp;</p>','<p>According to the Sanborn Maps from 1886, the area surrounding 23 Lynwood was very underdeveloped, and was likely in the very early stages of planning and development. The city was expanding as the population and production increased, although the development didn\'t reach this area until around the turn of the century. Before the houses were built in 1900, the area was likely used as storage or leisure space by the carriage and clothing companies that were stationed nearby. </p>','<p>Vision Government Solutions.

Located between Henry Austin’s City Hall and the Post Office, the Center rises above the older buildings and faces the New Haven Green. Designed by Crang &amp; Boake Architects of Toronto, the building is notable for its granite clad sides and pointed tent-like structure on its roof that give it a major presence on the New Haven skyline. Replacing the Powell Building (which was New Haven’s first skyscraper), the Center is the result of a long effort by the City of New Haven to build a financial center adjacent to City Hall. Currently home to a milieu of powerful institutions from Bank of America to the U.S. Attorney’s Office, the Connecticut Financial Center lives up to its name as the financial hub of New Haven.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>','25','0.61 acres; 19,750 sq feet ','<p><br></p>','<p>Totally modern yet totally respective of classical forms, the Connecticut Financial Center is in many ways the quintessential postmodern skyscraper. As dictated by Robert Venturi, postmodernism grew out of the intensive modernism of the 1950s and 60s. Venturi argued for an architecture that celebrated the existing architecture of a specific location, rather than rejecting it, and encouraged the use of fragmentation and unusual materials. It seems as though Crang &amp; Boake adhered closely to these principles of postmodernism when designing the Center, and rightfully so as the building occupies a crucial position in New Haven. Clad in pale pink granite (1), the building echoes the materials of its neighbors, City Hall and the Post Office, giving it a modern yet classical texture. Crang &amp; Boake employ a sort of geometrical ornamentation above the grand entrance by twisting the granite blocks inwards towards each other. As the building climbs, it steps back into itself as a nod to the great Art Deco skyscrapers and Yale’s Harkness Tower. At its top lies the building’s most unusual but yet most recognizable features, the three pyramid structures. Aligned perpendicular with Church Street, the three pyramids mirror the three iconic steeples on the Green. The central pyramid structure is raised above the others, essentially making it an open air tent perched on top of the building. Despite its intention to give the tower a memorable finish, the tent structure gives the appearance that someone is throwing a party on top of the building.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>','<p>Sitting back from Church Street and the Green, the Connecticut Financial Center dwarfs the buildings around it and rises dramatically as a monument to financial power. One must transcend a significant grade change from street to the tower’s front door. The gold letters spelling out the building’s name shine brightly, luring visitors towards its luxurious interior. Smashed between the classic structures of City Hall and the Post Office, the plaza in front of the building is a meeting place between the old and the new. The plaza is an open-air front porch to the Center, and a not terribly exciting front porch at that. Passerby cross the sidewalk in front of it, rarely venturing into the plaza unless to visit the building itself. To the left of the building is a narrow passageway that stretches through the block, filling in the space where Court Street once ran (2,3,4). Though certainly helpful in breaking up urban density, the passageway is nothing more than a glorified alley, a conduit between one street and another. The Connecticut Financial Center occupies an incredibly significant location in the city of New Haven and succeeds in many ways, but could further enhance the urban setting around it.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>','<p>The block of Church Street along the New Haven Green represents the institutionalization of power in New Haven over the 20th century. At the turn of the century, Henry Austin’s City Hall and the police headquarters were the only government buildings on the block (4). Small businesses with quaint, turn of the century names like White’s New Tontine Hotel and J.H. McDonald’s Livery occupied much of surrounding space (4). They represent a bygone era where local businesses, often owned by local families, played an important role in the American economy. Yale University even had property on the block via a Yale Storage Warehouse (4). By 1924, much had changed surrounding City Hall as Church Street became home to many important civic and financial institutions. The Powell Building, Fire Department Headquarters, the Plymouth Building, and the Second National Bank Building represent the solidification of institutions via building types meant to convey power (3). Especially with James Gamble Rogers’s Post Office, neoclassical forms were used to express the importance of government within the city. By 1974, as New Haven underwent urban renewal and deindustrialization, the block of Church Street surrounding City Hall had gradually decayed as many buildings were demolished, leaving a gaping hole in the block (2). In 1976, much of Henry Austin’s original City Hall building was demolished to make room for a new municipal complex, that would hopefully include a new office tower (1). Many New Haven mayors tried and failed to extend the civic and cultural importance of the Green past Church Street with a new development on the block.&nbsp;Ultimately, a long period of various redevelopment proposals resulted in the Connecticut Financial Center, a postmodern attempt to connect to the historic nature of the site and offer New Haven a true hub for finance just off the Green.&nbsp;</p>','<p>At the beginning of the 20th century, Henry Austin’s City Hall dominated the block of Church Street adjacent to the New Haven Green. The remainder of the block was occupied by various smaller commercial buildings owned by residents of New Haven (4). By 1924, architect Roy W. Foote designed the Powell Building (9) on the site where the Connecticut Financial Center now stands, which is considered to be New Haven’s first skyscraper. The building used neo-Gothic ornamentation on its top two floors and was home to a bank and some city offices (9). James Gamble Rogers’s Federal Post Office went up in 1913 (8), cementing the block of Church Street that runs along the Green as the home of New Haven’s primary governmental and financial institutions. Over the course of the twentieth century, New Haven was hit by hard economic times and much of the block around the Powell Building fell into decay. In 1967, the Powell Building and the Post Office were slated for demolition in order to develop the block into a new sleek, and modern Federal Plaza (5) that would destroy the Federal Post Office building. The project was abandoned and according to Vincent Scully, rightfully so, “since its sterile pretension would have easily rivaled that of Mussolini’s E.U.R.” (5) Though this specific project failed, dreams of redeveloping the governmental plaza, including preserving the historic buildings, did not die out. Yale’s own Paul Rudolph proposed a plan that kept the historic City Hall façade and the Post Office, but was ultimately deemed too expensive (7). In 1980, New Haven mayor Biagio DiLieto scaled back the size of the project due to budget concerns. It would now include just a new municipal building (including preserving the historical façade of City Hall) and a new office tower (1). Chase Enterprises was named as the developer of the project in 1982 and construction began on the tower in 1988 (1).</p><p><br></p>','<ol><li>Kennedy, Shawn G., “Real Estate; A Municipal Complex for New Haven.” April 6, 1988, <em>New York Times.</em> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/06/business/real-estate-a-municipal-complex-for-new-haven.html" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/06/business/real-estate-a-municipal-complex-for-new-haven.html</a>.</li><li>Sanborn Map Company of New York, Insurance Maps of New Haven Connecticut, Volume 1, 1973, 7.</li><li>Sanborn Map Company of New York, Insurance Maps of New Haven Connecticut, Volume 1, 1924, 7.</li><li>Sanborn-Ferris Map Co., Insurance Maps of New Haven, Connecticut Volume 1, 1901, 5.</li><li>Scully, Vincent. <em>American Architecture and Urbanism</em>.

The façade features large, imposing ionic columns, which frame the flight of stairs to the understated doors. The square, geometrically exact building is difficult to miss, as a stone stairway protrudes into the sidewalk. Furthermore, the building’s unique dark brick color differentiates it from the other buildings immediately nearby. While its grandiose, mansion-like appearance may indicate a residential use, the building’s location and Yale University placard demonstrate its true purpose: an University building. Currently, the building helps to house the psychology department, and its spaces are used for students and faculty to conduct research.</p>','4','<p>1902-1963 – Department of Geology</p><p>1963-Present – Department of Psychology</p>','<p>Large, dark colored brick makes up the entirety of Kirtland Hall. The building is sparsely decorated with layers of glass windows, built into the walls with small pediments decorating each one. The façade is the grandest part of this classical building, with four ionic columns raising from the staircase to a simple, rectangular pediment. The building is one concrete form, with little in the way of noticeable additions or alterations that imply different styles or shapes. One indication of addition is the top floor, built over the roof, with bricks slightly less worn. The building’s focus is on angular forms, and uses no rounded shapes besides the columns. Every element of the building is square or rectangular, with sharp corners and edges. The outliers to this style are the triangular indents above selected windows, as well as the columns. However, the ionic form of the columns, with the straight-line divots running the length of the columns, give them a more angular and rectangular appearance than the usual circular column form. Due to the size and scale of the building, there is almost a sense of tapering when one views it from the corner and looks up, due to the width of its base. The building’s original brick red color has faded throughout the years. Darker patches scatter the buildings walls and entry, and moss grows over the walls lining the staircases. The columns appear weathered as well, and are clearly not one form but rather slabs of column built up to create the entire shape. Some of these slabs may have been replaced over time, as sections of each column are noticeably lighter and less battered than others. The sides of the building are framed by plants and bushes, giving the appearance that Kirtland Hall has risen from the ground, and is a monument that has been relatively untouched since its creation over 100 years ago.&nbsp;</p>','<p>Kirtland Hall is on one of the most populated corners of academic buildings at Yale University. Hillhouse Ave contains mostly scientific buildings, and Kirtland Hall is no exception. It is dwarfed by the much larger Sheffield Sterling Strathcona (SSS) building to its left, and the Dunham Laboratory to its right. The SSS building occupies the entirety of the corner of Hillhouse and Grove Street, with a shape almost resembling the capital L letter, yet small paths that cut through the sidewalk corner straight through to Kirtland Hall give the sense that Kirtland is on its own corner as well. Bustling student life and frantic traveling from class to class defines the setting of the sidewalk throughout the entire week, but on weekends few people are to be found walking the purely academic area.&nbsp;</p>','<p>	For the entirety of Kirtland Hall’s history, it has functioned as a University site. Originally, it was a part of the Sheff School, a separate science school entity outside of Yale University. The Sheff School, founded in 1847 on what is currently Farnam Hall, operated outside of Yale University until the two became one in 1945 (4). Yet, the Sheff school did not reach the same heights as Yale. The school itself was very poor throughout its existence, and students paid a meager $30 for tuition. In the waning years of the 1800s and the beginning of the 1900s, Joseph Earl Sheffield had plans to expand the school and make it a richer and better facilitated learning space (4). Thus, he donated over one million dollars to the school’s expansion and betterment. Part of this money went to the construction of new laboratory and classroom spaces around Hillhouse Ave. Buildings, such as Leet Oliver Hall, Watson Hall, Mason Laboratory, Dunham Laboratory, and Sheffield-Sterling-Strathcona Hall were erected, as well as Kirtland Hall. These buildings drew students to the Sheff school, increasing enrollment by over 1000 students. The Sheff school did not provide housing for its students, explaining why there are no residential student houses near the Sheff school buildings (4).</p><p>	Kirtland Hall itself was founded in part by the donation of Sheffield, yet was mostly created due to the contribution of Mrs. Lucy Boardman (6). Mrs. Boardman dedicated the building to her uncle, Jared Potter Kirtland, an M.D. who studied at Yale University and was known for his geological survey of Ohio (5). Dr. Kirtland’s geological background gave rise to the building’s first function: the home of the Geology department (6). The familial ties within the building cannot be understated, as Kirtland’s great-grandson, Kirtland Kelsey Cutter, was the architect (1). Cutter was primarily known for his work in the state of Washington, and this building is one of his few on the East Coast (1). </p><p>The Department of Geology laid claim to Kirtland Hall until 1963, retaining its usage even through the unification of the Sheff School in 1945 (4, 6). However, after 1963 the building became a laboratory setting for psychology faculty and students, which it still functions as today (6). Kirtland Hall has always been an academic building, and its history within the Sheff school, and academic dedication to a renowned scientist reinforce its current function.</p>','<p>Maps indicate that Kirtland Hall has not changed much throughout its construction (2, 3). The Atlas of New Haven from 1911, under ten years after Kirtland’s construction, shows the exact same building shape that one can see today, both in person and on the Yale University map (2, 3). Currently, the most important area of the building is the basement, which houses research experiments that students can both run and participate in.&nbsp;</p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: white;">Arksey, Laura.

Built in the Greek Revival style popularized in New Haven by the architects Ithiel Towne and Alexander Jackson Davis, the flat brick façade and Doric columned portico present a quiet alternative to the neighboring crowded apartment complexes and rowdy fraternity houses that is almost hidden by the combined 11 stories of the looming Oxford and Cambridge apartment buildings.</p><p><br></p><p>Showing some signs of Queen Anne style in its portico and Italianate style through its windowed flat brick front with a protruding entryway, the building has been strictly a residential space since it’s erecting, stressing the residential character of High Street.</p>','<p>This 2½-story Greek Revival multi-family home, composed almost entirely of brick, has a combination of a gabled and hipped roof as well as a small portico entryway held up by Doric columns. The flat brick façade and columned portico make the residence at once both inviting and homey as well as subtle (6, 7).</p><p><br></p><p>Although a strong representation of the Greek Revival style, the littering of windows along three sides of the building (all but that which faces the Oxford building on the left) make a vague reference to the Italianate style, despite the lack of heavy brackets common to that style of home. Furthermore, the presence of the columned portico harks back to those often found in Queen Anne styled houses.</p><p><br></p><p>The unusual shape of the building layout — two connected, offset rectangles —&nbsp;emphasize the “multi” in multi-family home (see picture). Built to provide residence to multiple families, the layout highlights the inherit separation between these living spaces, without compromising the singularity of the plot of land. </p><p><br></p><p>The unusual shape found in the layout is also a by-product having one-half of the building destroyed to build the neighboring 36 High Street (Oxford apartments) in 1910 (5). As can be seen through the progression of the Sanborn maps, we see that initially (1886) there exists a singular lot and connected building, but in 1901, while there is still a connected building, the lot has been split in half (1, 2). Finally, in the 1924 map we see two separated buildings, 38 High Street and the Oxford Apartments, one occupying each lot (3, see picture).</p><p><br></p><p>Opposed from the above changes, the earliest known alterations to the building currently occupying 38 High Street occurred in the late 1930s and early 40s. Although most of these alterations are not described in great detail, they, too, emphasize the multi-family nature of the home as well as the buildings connection (or lack thereof) to the larger Oxford apartments next door: in 1941 there were additions for a bath room on the rear as well as an enclosed stairway “between two existing buildings” (presumably this is the now unused brick connection between the buildings at 36 and 38 High Street but could also be between 38 and 40 High Street, see picture) (8 pg. 1-3). </p><p><br></p><p>A key, yet only vaguely referenced, alteration to the building is the split of 38 High Street into 38 and 40 High Street. The New Haven City Directory does not mention a 40 High Street until about the 1950s, signaling it was at about this time that the building began its dual purpose (14). This could also explain some of the alterations done at the time. Furthermore, while the aforementioned floorplan makes this seem like a natural maneuver for the building, I speculate this split was accented in 2001/02 as there are a number of electrical and plumbing permits to “rewire 2 units completely” as well as “complete plumbing.” I theorize it was then that the buildings were effectively separated into two separate entities – each with their own set of plumbing and electrical wires (8 pg. 4-7, 9-10). There is also reference to a very large interior alteration where, among other unspecified alterations, an “existing ladder/stairway to the third floor” is removed and a new stairway constructed (8 pg. 8). My conjecture is that a stairway that previously united these now separate interiors was removed. </p><p><br></p><p>Finally, overall the external condition of the building is very good. The brick façade appears to be in excellent condition and only minimal weathering/wear and tear can be seen on the front steps (see picture).</p>','Unknown (although Greek Revival was a relatively common style for New Haven homes at the time)','<p>Earliest known owner: John T.

That being said, using the New Haven City Directories it appears that 38 High Street was vacant for a number of years in the 1930s, which <em>may</em> explain the sale to Cooney (14).</p>','<p>High Street itself is home to numerous Yale students, fraternities, and other groups and serves as a social space for Yalies. On any given day, you are likely to find undergraduates walking up and down the street talking to friends, going or leaving a party, making dinner, or getting together to study. Situated right next to campus and surrounded by the more commercial/restaurant-packed Chapel and Crown Streets, High Street provides students with the required proximity to both all forms of necessitates (food, classrooms, friends, social circles, etc.) and continues to serve its original residential purpose.</p><p><br></p><p>The aforementioned physical aspects of 38 High Street echo and fit into this residential character – the flat brick façade does not “interrupt the scale or rhythm of the streetscape”, nor do the half-dozen windows overlooking the street impose a voyeuristic perspective onto passersby (7). That being said, the stone steps leading up to the portico do just barely extend onto the sidewalk; although instead of detracting from the residential ambience of the street, this augments the inviting nature of the home. In fact, the stairs and portico, which are common to almost all of the buildings on High Street, serve an important purpose on the street –&nbsp;they provide their residents with a step to sit and chat on a warm day. In the spring and summer months those stairs are packed with students eating Salad Shop, talking about their classes, or socializing with their friends. </p><p><br></p><p>A quiet alternative to the massive Oxford and Cambridge apartment buildings or rowdy fraternity houses across the street, 38 High Street maintains the familial core of High Street retained even through the commercialization of the Chapel Street District as a whole in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, while also alluding to the social connections brought about by that change (7).&nbsp;</p>','<p>The Chapel Street district has always served as a core commercial and residential area of New Haven. Going through periods of explosive growth, both commercial and other, the area has transitioned tremendously from the original nine square plan to the teeming hub of the city it is today (7, 9). </p><p><br></p><p>That being said, High Street has always been a residential nucleus among the hubbub of Chapel Street. The boom of the commercial area, saw an increased need for residential housing as well. It was during this mid-nineteenth century craze that 38 High Street was built (c. 1840). A callback to the residential nature of the Chapel Street district during the nineteenth century as well as the popularization of the Greek Revival style by Ithiel Towne and Alexander Jackson David, the house was built in that style using brick, a material that was at once desirable as well as expensive. The style and material were meant to showcase a certain wealth of the residents (7).</p><p><br></p><p>Although it is not clear who originally commissioned the house, the earliest known owner was John T. Sloan, the President of John T. Sloan Co., real estate and insurance agents. The story of John T. Sloan and his real estate company mimic that of the “growth and development of New Haven” – starting when there were very few ‘modern’ buildings and taking advantage of the opportunity to ‘modernize’ the cities office and residential buildings (4). </p><p><br></p><p>Serving successfully as a multi-family home yielded its pluses, however the same modernizing city that enabled displays of such wealthy houses also created an issue –&nbsp;the skyrocketing population required more and more housing. In regards to 38 High Street, this shift materialized itself in the construction of the Oxford Apartments at 36 High Street necessitating the plot of land to be split and half of 38 High Street to be destroyed (5). This was an iconic shift in the landscape of High Street and the Chapel Street district as a whole and although it is not clear, I would not be surprised if it was around this time that John A. Cooney acquired the building from John T. Sloan. The construction of large apartment complexes represented a shift from the familial nature of many of the homes on the street to a grand-residential area, complementing the commercial nature of Chapel Street itself.</p><p><br></p><p>However, this era was stopped short by the Great Depression which halted most construction in the United States. By the close of the Great Depression, John A. Cooney had acquired the building and performed the requisite alterations to make it residentially popular once again (5, 8).</p><p><br></p><p>Although not much is known of the residents during the subsequent time period, a few writers (such as Mrs. Emma Joyner circa 1952) and other scholars inhabited the premises (14). Continuing to serve as a residential space for New Haven residents and Yalies alike, 38 High Street has retained its familial ambience.&nbsp;</p>','<p>As depicted by the Sanborn Maps of New Haven, we see that by 1886 the plot of 38 High Street was occupied by a fairly large residential building (1). Being a premier real estate location, the use of this site by brokers such as John T. Sloan is not surprising, nor is the subsequent split of the site in half (2, 3, see picture). </p><p><br></p><p>In what was most likely an aim to keep up with rising residential demand, the destruction of half the property to build the Oxford Apartments represents the last shift in site to date (2, 3, 5).&nbsp;</p>','<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sanborn Map Company of New York, Insurance Maps of New Haven Connecticut, Volume 2, 1886.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sanborn Map Company of New York, Insurance Maps of New Haven Connecticut, Volume 2, 1901.</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sanborn Map Company of New York, Insurance Maps of New Haven Connecticut, Volume 1, 1924.</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Modern Connecticut Homes and Homecrafts: A Book of Representative Houses, Interiors, Gardens, Decorations, Furnishings and Equipment Appropriately Described and Illustrated by Several Hundred Beautiful Engravings</em> (American Homecrafts Company, 1921), 148-149, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pkhIAAAAYAAJ" target="_blank">https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pkhIAAAAYAAJ</a></p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Haven Historic Resources Inventory, Phase I, Volume III, 413</p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elizabeth Mills Brown, <em>New Haven: A Guide to Architecture and Urban Design</em> (Yale Univ.

Its small windows are nearly unnoticed in the architecture. Even the glass podium does not reveal much, as it is recedes into the building (1). As imposing and closed off as it may seem from the streets, the Laboratory of Epidemiology and Public Health (LEPH) is open to affiliated students and visitors. From inside the block, LEPH is surrounded by greenery and open walkways. It’s settled on the corner of a block containing many of Yale’s Medical School buildings. Among these buildings, LEPH stands out against the neighboring façades. Its tan, geometric construction is stark against the red brick loft style structures around it—fitting as it is the only building to be both a part of Yale’s School of Medicine and Yale’s School of Public Health (2).&nbsp;</p>','<p>LEPH<strong> </strong>is situated in a region of high building density (1). It sits on an irregularly shaped block containing most of Yale’s medical studies buildings (3). Many buildings in the area are either institutional, commercial, or residential (1). Examples of nearby establishments include a corporate office building, a restaurant, a bank, and a hospital (3). A bus station is located right next to LEPH and there are multiple parking lots, all less than a block away (4).</p>','<p>Since the construction of this building, there has not been a change in ownership or tenancy (1). </p>','Yale School of Public Health','<p>At 9 stories tall, LEPH does not quite tower over the structures surrounding it. However, held up by large, concrete pilasters—8 on each longitudinal side and clearly visible on the exterior—the building is stretched upwards. Combined with the 2 story glass podium, slightly hidden behind the supportive columns, LEPH has the illusion of being more than it actually is. By nature of the podium’s recessed design, the exterior is made to look thick and blockish. The heavyset masonry hoods, jutting outwards and sandwiching the building’s small windows, fortifies this aesthetic interpretation. Yet, these linear embellishments also create a sort of charm—there is elegance in the simplicity and repetition of the building. The lower level’s glass walls, concrete overhang, and lush surrounding greenery proposes the notion of a comfortable—modern, even—academic space (1). In line with that, LEPH has been consistently renovated and updated to maintain its stance as a top rated program and facility (3, 16).</p>','<p>Built in 1963, LEPH stands as a relatively recent addition to New Haven. It was commissioned by Yale and has not changed ownership since. The initial architect, Philip Johnson, was no stranger to Yale’s campus. Johnson had been working on Yale’s Kline Biology Tower when he was asked to design LEPH. He shared during an interview that the design process for LEPH was fast and easy, but that the final look was not what he had in mind. Johnson had given the project over to a second architect, the Office of Douglas Orr, whom he blames for the aspects of the building that he considers aesthetic mistakes. Notably, Johnson fixates on the small windows which contradict his original plans for a bolder look. (1)</p><p>Regardless of the construction mishaps between the two lead architects, LEPH represents and holds an impressive entity. LEPH came to be as a result of a new graduate department at Yale: the Department of Epidemiology and Public Health. Originally, this department began as a concentration under Yale’s Medical School. Its accreditation in 1946 made it not only one of the first 8 accredited schools for public health, but also uniquely a professional public health school that simultaneously branches off a separate graduate program. The year after LEPH was built, the Department of Epidemiology and Public Health moved in. The department is still located there today. (3)&nbsp;</p><p>While LEPH houses a globally renowned institution, it also encompasses local tensions. Urban renewal—the process of redeveloping areas in cities, usually involving the clearance of slums— is a&nbsp;problem commonly seen throughout New Haven (20). The imposition of Yale buildings into organic neighborhoods has always been somewhat disruptive. Within the neighborhood, the Hill, the placement of the majority of Yale Medical School buildings and Yale-affiliated hospitals have created a strain between local residents and university faculty and students. Though university “research parks,” like the one LEPH is located in, results in more federal and state funding, benefits are largely not shared with the local community (5). The fundamental problem here reflects a large theme in general history—that is, an affluent agent imposing itself on established territory for unequal profit.&nbsp;</p>','<p>60 College Street, New Haven, CT was not always a working address. In fact, before the late 1950s, the street layout of the northern Hill area was entirely different (13, 14, 15). What is currently a research park and a civically exacerbated environment, was once a vibrant community of residents and workers—diverse in ethnicity, religion, and interest (17, 18, 19).</p><p>In 1957, a large plot of land south of Oak Street was demolished and rearranged. Hundreds of businesses and twice as many households were displaced. Richard C. Lee, mayor at the time, took advantage of the immigrant families settled in the neighborhood. Using their housing as a reason—he argued that there was a potential for deterioration into slums—, Lee excused his actions. Oak Street was replaced by the Oak Street Connector, a highway section of Route 34 (7). It was not just the mayor, though. City planners had this same goal, along with others in mind. Notably, Maurice Rotival’s city plan involved the centering of the city around Downtown New Haven, elimination of slums, and the “consolidation of Yale as a resource for the city” (6). True, the Oak Street Connector resulted in part from the country’s highway craze. However, it was also built to purposely remove certain demographics (the ones kicked out) and to satisfy others (indirectly satisfied those in charge of the city, through Yale). The resulting area south of the Oak Street Connector became Yale’s medical-hospital complex, a new Oak Street neighborhood, new residential/market spaces, and a railroad station (6).&nbsp;</p><p>Decades later, animosity towards the Oak Street Connector still existed. In 2013, efforts were made to try and reconnect the Hill to Downtown New Haven. The Downtown Crossing project includes, among other things, pocket parks, new bike lanes in place of highway ramps, and real estate development. Vacant and run-down plots are also being converted into usable commercial space (7). It will be some time before New Haven’s homeless population is effectively reduced, and it will be an even longer before the neighborhood’s cultural damage is rectified. In a way, LEPH and all of the Yale’s buildings in the Hill represents a recurring subject in architectural history: the applications and ramifications of power.&nbsp;</p>','<p>(1) New Haven Historic Resources Inventory (New Haven: The New Haven Preservation Trust).

(5) (4) The new concentration of fraternity houses on Park Street garnered the area the unofficial title of “Fraternity Row,” and the shift to these new Tudor Revival houses enabled fraternities to suddenly open up their gatherings to the greater student body. (4) Yet, university policy changes, with the introduction of the residential college system and required on-campus meals, in the following decades threatened fraternities’ presence on campus, especially their function as a student dining place. (4) Indeed, the residential college were rivals of these houses, intended to make the benefits of fraternity organizations available to everyone. (5) For much of the first half of the 20th century, the Yale Cabaret building was occupied by Phi Gamma Delta and its neighbors were home to Chi Psi, Zeta Psi, Psi Upsilon, and Beta Theta Pi. (6) (7) (8) Phi Gamma Delta gave the building over to Yale in 1950, and many of the old fraternities on “Fraternity Row” similarly closed their doors and followed suite. (3) Amidst the chaos of change in the 1960s, as the university becomes coed and New Haven faces numerous urban renewal campaigns, the building becomes a Yale School of Drama space and graduate theater students found the Yale Cabaret in the building’s basement in 1968.

Its brick facade shows significant weathering and age, which is understandable as the house approaches being a century old. Only a small portion of the building faces onto Park Street. In fact, the main entrance is located on the side of building, slightly obscured from street view. The house has an unassuming demeanor. It does not proclaim itself, but blends in stylistically with the surrounding buildings and is largely hidden from street view. In contrast, its basement dinner theater has become famous and has been graced by performances of theater students who have gone off to become very prominent actors and actresses. &nbsp;But perhaps it is, in fact, the perfect physical expression of the Yale Cabaret’s values as a place for experimentation and artistic exploration. Its quieter, non-overpowering presence strengthens the focus on the artistic performances and stories told every weekend. </span></p><p>	<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The house still bears markers from the days that it served as a fraternity. The building’s side facing Park Street still displaces a stone sign detailing “Vernon Hall” and Phi Gamma Delta’s Greek Letters. Next to the main entrance remains the fraternity’s crest, comprised of an owl and three clematis blooms. (1) In addition, it now sports modern signs indicating that it is the location of the Yale Cabaret, which is celebrating its 50th year. </span></p><p>	<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The house had alterations in the 1940s, with renovations to its stairs in 1945 and the erection of a temperature partition in its basement in 1946. Minor alterations to the basement, first and second floor were completed later in 1968, the year that the Yale Cabaret was founded. The house was renovated further in 1993 and 2016 to increase the buildings accessibility. In 1993, renovations were completed to create an exterior handicap ramp and interior handicap lifts. In 2016, the building was renovated to include a wheelchair lift. (2) </span></p><p><br></p>');

Visitors immediately recognize its monumental architectural significance, even before they look above the four columns surrounding the door and see, engraved into the marble, “Free Public Library.” Two sets of stairs, in between two small yards surrounded by balustrade, lead visitors to the façade of the brick building, constructed in the colonial revival style between 1908 and 1911. For over 100 years now, the building has served a singular purpose: providing New Haven residents access to free books and resources. Its purpose was utilitarian, but its monumentality stemmed from the City Beautiful movement and New Haven’s Civic Improvement Committee, which sought to “improve the civic image of the city,” according to Preston Maynard of the New Haven Preservation Trust. The library previously existed in buildings on Chapel Street and Church Street, but it has remained in this location on Elm Street since Mary Ives donated $300,000 to the city to construct a fireproof library. In 1987, the city began a $14.5 million renovation project that expanded the building by 65,000 square feet, to 103,000 square feet. The renovation restored the building and maintained its style, while modernizing the building itself. According to the library’s description, “The new construction was designed to integrate with and complement the old, while, at the same time, proclaiming its own contemporary identity.”</p>','3 and basement','152’ x 104’ (before expansion; NHFPL librarian did not have dimensions of the expanded library)','<p>1906-1968, City of New Haven</p><p>1968-1984, State of Connecticut</p><p>1984-present, City of New Haven</p>','<p>	A 1981 report for the Historic Resources Inventory of the Connecticut Historical Commission describes the NHFPL in great detail. Constructed from 1908-1911 in the colonial revival style as part of the City Beautiful movement, the library is a monumental building and a defining feature of downtown New Haven. The three-story masonry building sits on a raised foundation with an attached wing in the rear. The Elm Street façade features a long stylobate with two sets of stairs rising to a center pavilion. </p><p>	The front pavilion is surrounded on both sides by small yards, which are “terraced and have balustrade surrounding the parcel.” The center window, above the entrance, has a cornice head. The windows on the side bays have a molded surround. The Elm Street façade also has four engaged columns that support “an entablature with modillion cornice.” The windows are “symmetrical between the columns.” The entry is “recessed in a pedimented surround with paneled reveal.” Single bays, one per side, border the pavilion. The bays have “tall, arched window openings” on the first floor, “with multi-paned sash.” The bays have “molded surround with cut-stone keystone and impost blocks.” </p><p>	The corners of the buildings on the Elm Street façade have “paired pilasters rising to the entablature and balustrade” mentioned earlier. “A large watertable defines the jointure of upper stories to the foundation,” and both sides of the building (east and west) are five bays wide. Each bay has a “center pavilion which projects only slightly from the main building,” and that pavilion “is framed by paired pilasters.” The windows are symmetrical and the fenestration “consists of tall arched window openings with multi-paned sash and marble keystone and impost block.” The windows also have a “table-like sill supported by small consoles.” The windows on the second story are smaller, with a 15x15 sash with a “shouldered architrave.” </p><p>	At the time the report was made, there was a sunken parking lot in the rear yard. But a renovation and expansion was completed in 1990, which greatly expanded the size of the library by 65,000 square feet, to 103,000 square feet. The addition was added in the rear of the building, made to look like part of the original structure, with the same style of bays and windows added. One would not be able to tell an expansion occurred from the outside, although it is quite clear from the interior. The point at which the reference desk is today located marks the start of the expanded area. There are areas of the original exterior wall that are now part of the interior, and today they sit next to stacks of books. </p><p>	Still, the entrance to the library remains the same. Visitors enter from Elm Street to “a vestibule and stairhall.” “Curvilinear staircases and walls” mark the two-story building (actually three plus a basement, but two are below street level). Visitors walk through the vestibule to a large lobby and circulation room, which is “a monumental space, two-stories in height, rising to a cove ceiling with stain-glass skylight.” Today, the library feels immense, but it was much more compact before its expansion. What is today the local history room, to the left off the main lobby, used to be the fiction section. The downstairs floor used to house the children’s books, and today it is used as a program room. Today, after walking past the gray carpet that marks the end of the old library, visitors encounter a reference desk, tables for working and tables with computers, and fiction stacks.&nbsp;</p>','<p>	The NHFPL is located on the northeast corner of the New Haven Green, at the corner of Elm and Temple Streets. The only buildings on the Green are three churches. But all around the library there is high building density, with Yale buildings, buildings offering community services, and restaurants. The library sits next to the New Haven Superior Court, which was also built, according to its 1981 description by the Connecticut Historical Commission’s Historical Resources Inventory, as “part of an overall scheme to improve the civic image of the city.” </p><p>	The NHFPL plays a monumental role on the Green, anchoring its many different milieu. It has been in the same location for over 100 years, and its continued existence stands in stark contrast to modern retail chains like Chipotle and Starbucks, which are located directly across the Green from the library. To the west of it sit several Yale buildings, including the Yale University Press and the Yale Visitors Center. The library almost signals the start of the “rest” of New Haven, marking the point at which the city stops being a university town and starts offering resources to its residents.&nbsp;</p>','<p>	After the City of New Haven purchased this lot on Elm Street in 1906, it remained in the city’s hands for most of its history. In 1968, the city sold the building to the State of Connecticut for $800,000, in keeping with the guidance of the city’s Renewal Program for a new central library building. (At this point, the NHFPL system had several other branches.) During this time, the building’s operations did not change; it remained the main branch of the NHFPL. But in 1984, the city purchased the building back for the same price, opting for a renovation and expansion at the Elm Street site over relocation. In 1987, the city began a $14.5 million renovation and expansion, and the renovated building was opened in 1990. The building was expanded by 65,000 square feet, to 103,000 square feet. In its larger space, the Ives Main Library plays the same role it did over 100 years ago when it opened: giving all New Haven residents “full and unlimited access to information and knowledge,” according to its mission statement.&nbsp;</p>','<p>	Before this lot on Elm Street was purchased in 1906, no building existed in the exact location of the library. An 1888 map shows that the lot on which the library was later built was owned by T.R. Trowbridge at the time, although it is unknown if he owned the land up to its purchase by the city in 1906.&nbsp;</p>');

In newspaper clippings about Tuttle Tavern, it was noted that during the British Invasion of New Haven, British soldiers had cooked a meal at Tuttle Tavern (4). The City of New Haven map from 1812 features Tuttle Tavern directly adjacent to a public well and hay weighing station (3).</p><p>The building continues to be Tuttle Tavern until May 1835 when the building is advertised as “valuable real estate for sale” in a newspaper advertisement (4). According to city directories, Tuttle Tavern becomes Broadway Hotel owned by Charles S. Ackley at some point between 1835 and 1849. Clark Lum obtains ownership of Broadway Hotel in 1850 and the Lum family continues to run it until 1856 when the hotel is moved to Goffe Street and “The First Christ Church,” owned by Society of Christ Church Parish, is moved to the site. The Society of Christ Church Parish built “The Second Christ Church” on the site in 1859, and the current Christ Church building began construction in 1894.</p>','<p>This 1-story gothic revival building constructed in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century is composed of red sandstone, gable roofs, majestic lancet windows, stained glass, and a prominent tower. Additionally, an adjacent parish house was later constructed in 1902 and most of the stained-glass windows were installed in a separate project in the early 1900s (5, 2). The Christ Church façade appears to have a rustic dark red/brown exterior from afar and a more pattered façade upon closer inspection. The stonework is differently-sized rectangular stones that appear in a spectrum of colors from light red to brown to black. The stones appear weathered and aged, but not damaged. The church floor is elevated from ground level with three large stone steps radiating from the front entrance.</p><p>An iconic eighty-foot square tower with four pinnacles adds a vertical element to the building with a large cross that is integrated into the tower façade. The vertical nature of the building reflects the spiritual mission of the building—to point toward the heavens (5). Deaconess Josephine A. Lyon writes that the tower “remind[s] us of the source of all good gifts and to symbolize the aspirations of the faithful” (5).</p><p>Christ Church sets itself apart from other gothic revival buildings because the style of this building is derived from a specific version of English, late medieval architecture and inspired by the Magdalen College in Oxford (1). This architecture reflects the Anglo-Catholic style of worship that is practiced in Christ Church. </p><p>While the outside is not very decorative, the interior woodwork is very intricate and stained glass windows are very colorful. The woodcarving, done by Johannes Kirchmayer, includes a carved screen surrounding the altar (1). These decorative pieces were also intended to revive the Anglo-Catholic style of worship.</p>','<p>The current building has always been owned and occupied by the Society of Christ Church Parish since its construction in 1894 (5). The church had two previous iterations, the “First Christ Church” and “Second Christ Church,” on the same site. Both were owned and operated by the Society of Christ Church Parish since 1854. While the current building was not constructed until 1894, the social history of the Society of Christ Church’s presence on Broadway dates back to 1854 when it opened its doors to the First Christ Church (1).</p><p>Since its early days, the church has had a complicated history with exclusion. Over time, however, the church’s decisions generally reflect efforts at inclusivity that continue to define its mission. In 1861 during a period of financial instability, it was proposed that pews in Christ Church would be available for rent only (5). However, the bishop at the time expressed strong intent on the “Free Church principle,” allowing those who could not afford to rent pews the opportunity to continue attending church services. It is important to note, however, that the Church did not always rule in favor of inclusion. In the 1880s, the Bishop declined women in the parish the ability to vote on the basis that the pronouns in the canon were masculine (5). Additionally, the history detailed in the book <em>The Chronicle of Christ Church</em> does not mention any people of color, and it is unclear when the church opened doors to non-white groups. In a more modern context, Christ Church now states that it “seeks to be an example of progressive Anglo-Catholicism” and “has long affirmed the role of women in the church’s ordained ministry, and is inclusive of all persons irrespective of race, gender, sexual orientation, social class, or any other differentiation” (1). </p><p>The Christ Church’s mission to “seek to ground people’s lives in the intentional worship of God and acts of service to the community” is echoed in the church’s ministries: St. Hilda’s House and Community Soup Kitchen (1). St. Hilda’s House was established in 1910, and the resident deaconesses served the children, poor, and orphaned until the 1970s. The ministry continues today as a group of young adults who serve the community with the same mission of the original deaconesses and their ministries. Community Soup Kitchen has been operating since 1978 and currently serves as New Haven’s primary soup kitchen five days a week. In an interview with a staff member at the Community Soup Kitchen, he states that everything about Christ Church, from the architecture to its ministries, reflect Catholic beliefs of community service, acceptance, and dedication to God’s mission in Jesus Christ.&nbsp;</p>','<p>Christ Church sits at the intersection of Broadway and Elm St. in stark contrast to the commercial and residential buildings in the area. The surrounding landscape includes a stone memorial with a fence. The building is framed by two busy roads overlooks Broadway Triangle Park.</p><p>As New Haven has grown and the Broadway area has become a commercial district, Christ Church has encompassed a new role in urban ministry. Although surrounding Broadway stores and buildings cater to upper middle-class shoppers and students, Christ Church’s parish house runs Community Soup Kitchen five days a week and appears to be the only building in the area that serves low-income and/or homeless people of New Haven. It is clear that the nearby “Shops at Yale” actively alienate this population with large signs in the Broadway Triangle Park that read “It’s ok to say no to panhandling” and “Please report aggressive panhandling to the New Haven Police.”</p>','Society of Christ Church Parish','<p>This church is a late gothic revival building featuring a red sandstone façade, gable roofs, and most notably an eighty-foot square tower. The church’s interior is notable for its detailed woodwork and beautiful stained glass windows. Christ Church has been a center of Anglo-Catholic worship since 1895 and continues its mission of active community service through ministries such as Community Soup Kitchen.</p>','<p><span style="color: black;">1.

Part clapboard and part brick, this building has had a storied history over its almost 200 years of existence. Originally a Federal style house, (much like its neighbor, 66 Wall St.,) it has been transformed into the Second Empire style, with its characteristic Mansard roof, pilaster-framed dormer windows, and Victorian portico. 320 Temple was once the home of Jedidiah Morse, "the founder of modern geography," and is currently used as practice rooms for the Yale School of Music.</p>','<p>1820s: Jedidiah Morse</p><p>1880s: John S.

It has a Mansard roof, a Victorian portico with ionic columns, and three porches, each framed by columns. Each window on the roof is also framed by columns. It has a basement now used for storage. The roof is slate and has a colorful row of tiles along the top. The building originally was in the Federal style (much like 66 Wall St.) but was completely renovated c. 1875 into the Second Empire Style. The roof and octagonal tower were added in this renovation, as were the porches.</p>','<p>The urban context for this building is almost entirely Yale University buildings, save for the United Church Parish House across the street. Over its history, this landscape has changed dramatically. Upon its construction c. 1820, 320 Temple was in a mostly residential neighborhood as one of many homes lining Temple St. Throughout the entire 19<sup>th</sup> century, the Temple St. between Elm St. and Wall St. remained largely residential. (2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11) In the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, Yale began to expand in that area. 320 Temple was purchased by Yale in 1921, and with the construction of Silliman and Timothy Dwight Colleges in the 1930s, the neighborhood became increasingly Yale dominated. (5,12) Now, 320 Temple is in the vicinity of the Slifka Center for Jewish Life (80 Wall St.), the Yale School of Music’s Adams Center (165 Elm), and Yale University Press (302 Temple St.).</p>','<p>320 Temple was built c. 1820 for Reverend Jedidiah Morse, known as “the father of American geography” and father of Samuel P. Morse. (2, 12, 13) For the rest of the 19<sup>th</sup> century and the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, the building was occupied by a variety of tenants, including John C. Beach (11), George L. and Elizabeth Dickerman,&nbsp;(3, 7) and Joseph Marshall Flint. (8) The large-scale renovation of this building that transformed it into the Second Empire Style occurred during this time (c. 1875). In 1921, the building was purchased by Yale University and used as dormitories until 1958.(12, 13) In 1958 (13) the building was renovated for office use. From 1958 – at least 1968, 320 Temple was the site of the Yale Alumni House. (5, 12, 13) From the room assignment plan of the building (visible in the Media section) we see designations for a resident suite for a “management couple” in residence. (6) A 1960 directory lists the contact for the Alumni House as Robert A. Toti, who likely was a permanent resident in the house. (9) These plans are undated, but the existence of assignment plans likely points to a time where rooms are being reassigned in function, such as the establishment of the Alumni House in 1958. The more recent history of the building is less clear in timeline. In 1981, 320 Temple was home to the Yale Religious Studies Department.(13) Anecdotal evidence supports that the building remained part of the Religious Studies Department until the early 21<sup>st</sup> century, when it assumed its current use: practice rooms for the Yale School of Music. To make more practice rooms, passageways between rooms were plastered. This building was heavily used by Yale music students during the renovation of Hendrie Hall, but is now largely empty. The building is largely unmaintained, as a trip inside will reveal peeling paint, cracking doorframes, and dusty carpets.</p>','<p>There is not much information available regarding the early history of the site. Many neighboring houses such as 328 Temple St. (built for another Yale alumnus, John Hart Lynde) (5) were built around the same time, implying there was a wider interest in the neighborhood at the time. The site is in close proximity to both the Green and Yale, likely a reason why Jedidiah Morse, both a reverend and a Yale alumnus, chose it as location for his home. 320 Temple is adjacent to a large parking lot for the School of Music.</p>','<p>&nbsp;(1) <em>320 Temple</em>.

Mott (pre-1913/1913 until sometime before 1973)</span></li></ul><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span class="ql-cursor">﻿</span>The exact length of both residents’ tenancy at 261-263 Crown Street is unknown, but their names were listed as living at those addresses in the New Haven 1913 Directory (1). &nbsp;By 1973, they no longer occupied the lot as the building there had been demolished and the lot was left empty (2).</span></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This 1 story-establishment is composed of brick and features handcrafted woodwork including a red door and red shutters framing the windows (3). &nbsp;The wooden elements are evocative of half-timbering characteristic of Tudor-style architecture, and the brick archways that frame the door and windows are suggestive of the same style as well (4). &nbsp;Two casement-like round-top windows. one on either side of the door, have cream colored diamond-shaped lattice designs that contrast with the red hue of the bricks and shutters (5). &nbsp;The building has a flat roof as well as a brown-shingled shed roof attached to three sides of the building about a foot below the flat rooftop (6). &nbsp;When the building was moved from its original location at George and Temple Streets in 1975, a $35,500 addition was made to expand the building on the Crown Street site, increasing the building’s capacity from 14 persons to approximately 24 persons (7). &nbsp;The bricks used to build the walls of the addition were sourced from the floor of the old George Street tannery (this building had served as office space for the tannery before it was occupied by Louis’ Lunch) as well as demolished buildings in New Haven (8). &nbsp;Kenneth Lassen, the building’s owner at the time of the addition, also collected bricks from friends, family, and even strangers all over the world that were used in the expansion of the original structure (9). &nbsp;The cozy interior of the building features an open kitchen with a service bar, exposed brick on the walls, as well as robust wooden furniture and a wood-paneled ceiling (10). &nbsp;</span></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Louis’ Lunch is situated on Crown Street, which hosts a blend of commercial and residential buildings and lots (11). &nbsp;Unlike the other buildings on the street, which stand in close proximity to one another, Louis’ stands alone and the building is surrounded by parking lots on three sides. &nbsp;It is also interesting to note that Louis’ sits further back from the sidewalk than the other buildings on the street, adding a fourth dimension to the physical separation that the building has from neighboring structures. &nbsp;Louis’ eye-catching brick and wood entrance causes the building to stand out as its own vibrant entity amidst what appears to be an otherwise fairly neutral urban landscape. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In 1895 Louis Lassen, a New Haven resident, opened a lunch wagon and stationed himself on Meadow Street in downtown New Haven, and thus Louis’ Lunch was born (12).&nbsp;A short five years later, history was made when Louis himself created and served the first hamburger from that very same wagon (13).&nbsp;After moving to George Street in 1907, and spending more than 10 years working out of his wagon there, Louis finally found a more permanent home for his restaurant in 1917, a little brick building at the corner of Temple and George Streets (14).&nbsp;The main portion of the building that Louis’ Lunch now occupies was built in the mid 19th century as a part of an industrial complex and up until 1917 the structure served as an office space for the neighboring George Street tannery (15).&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">For nearly fifty years the Lassen family served hamburgers from that location, and Louis’ Lunch quickly became a beloved lunch spot for New Haveners and tourists alike (16).&nbsp;Official recognition of the restaurant’s significance came in September of 1967, when the New Haven Preservation Trust made Louis’ Lunch an official monument (17).&nbsp;However, trouble still came for Louis’ in the mid 20th century during the mayorship of Richard C. Lee when a wave of urban renewal initiatives were implemented with the intent to transform New Haven into a “Model City” (18).&nbsp;A major side effect of this renewal was the demolition of over 2,000 buildings in order to create spaces for redevelopment (19).&nbsp;What is more, in March of 1974, the New Haven Redevelopment Agency approved plans to build the multi-million dollar Temple Street Medical Center where Louis’ stood (20).&nbsp;This decision was met with public outcry, and so the fight to save Louis’ began (21).&nbsp;Just three months later, the public’s pleas were met with the Agency’s promise to pay $8,500 to move the building that Louis’ Lunch occupied to another location (22).&nbsp;In June 1975, Louis’ Lunch closed, and in July the entire building was put on a truck and driven the two blocks to its current location on Crown Street (23).</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Not only was the building preserved during this transition, so were the traditions within it.&nbsp;Today, burgers at Louis’ are served the same way they were over a century ago, on white Pepperidge Farm toast sliced diagonally (24).&nbsp;Ketchup and mustard are nowhere to be found, and a sign inside sums up Louis’ approach to burgers pretty well: “This is not Burger King, you don’t get it your way.&nbsp;You take it my way, or you don’t get the damn thing.”&nbsp;The building remains the only example of pre-1900 architecture to have survived urban renewal efforts in downtown New Haven and thus serves to keep an important part of the city’s history alive that has otherwise disappeared (25).&nbsp;The bricks of so many buildings that were demolished live on in the walls of Louis’, alongside bricks donated by people and places all over the world (26).&nbsp;Louis’ Lunch may be small in square footage, but the immense significance that it holds not only as the home of the original hamburger, but also as a time capsule of New Haven history and the world, is what truly renders Louis’ Lunch a monument.</span></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In 1886, the lot at 261-263 Crown Street was occupied by a brick dwelling that appears to have been split into two separate (but attached) homes (27). &nbsp;According to the New Haven 1913 Directory, both sides of the dwelling were occupied for some time, with Mrs. Rachel Thill living at 261 Crown Street and Mr. Berry L. Mott living at the 263 address (28). &nbsp;The length of their tenancy is unknown, but the 1973 New Haven Sanborn map reveals the dwelling to be gone by that point, leaving the lot empty (29). &nbsp;On June 27, 1975 Kenneth Lassen revealed that the lot of 261-283 Crown Street had been purchased and that it would be the new home of Louis’ Lunch (30). &nbsp;The original building was moved to the new site in July of 1975 and has remained there ever since (31). &nbsp;An addition for the structure was built in 1975, expanding the building to its current dimensions of approximately 26’ x 36’ (32). &nbsp;</span></p>','<ol><li><em>New Haven Directory</em> (New Haven: Price &amp; Lee Co., 1913), 895.</li><li>Sanborn Map Co., Insurance Maps of New Haven Connecticut, Vol. 1, 1973, 3.</li><li>New Haven Historic Resources Inventory (New Haven: The New Haven Preservation Trust).</li><li>New Haven Historic Resources Inventory; <em>Encyclopaedia Britannica</em>, s.v. “Tudor Style,” accessed February 24, 2018, https://www.britannica.com/art/Tudor-style.</li><li>New Haven Historic Resources Inventory.</li><li>Ibid.</li><li>Stanley J.

The famous Pierson Tower, the only visible piece of Pierson which can be seen from outside the York Street Gate, was modeled after the tower in Philadelphia’s Independence Hall. The four-story buildings all surround and overlook a courtyard, completely hidden from the street. Pierson College was designed by the architect James Gable Rogers in the Georgian, or “Georgian Revival” style. This explains the symmetry of Pierson’s layout, its sloping, even roof, as well as its predominately brick façade. (3) These features also create an eerie likeness to traditional plantations of the antebellum South. As a result of this Southern similarity, the Lower Court of Pierson College was formerly referred to as the “Slaves’ Quarters”. (2) This nickname was retired in 2004, when Yale finished a yearlong renovation of Pierson. This renovation added a completely new residential building along the walkway into Pierson from York Street, known as Upper Court. With this addition, the “Slaves’ Quarters” became known as the more appropriate Lower Court. Home to nearly 500 undergraduate students, Pierson is the largest residential college of the 14.&nbsp;</p>','<p><span style="color: black;">Built in 1933, Pierson College is one of the eight original residential colleges of Yale University. (1) Hidden behind gates opening onto both York and Park Street, the only visible part of Pierson from the street is the Pierson Tower, modeled after the one in Philadelphia’s Independence Hall (2). All four stories of Pierson surround a lush, quaint courtyard to be enjoyed by the nearly 500 undergraduate students who reside within the gates. Designed by James Gable Rogers, Pierson embodies the Georgian, or “Georgian Revival”, architectural style. (1)</span></p>','<p> </p>','<p><span style="color: black;">Pierson college is located between York Street and Park Street, in the Downtown neighborhood of New Haven. It is hidden from the street, and blends in with the surrounding urban landscape. On one side is the Yale Dramat Theater. On the other side is Davenport College. This part of York street is sandwiched in between two more commercial blocks, with Yorkside Pizza, Toad’s Place, and Blue State Coffee in one direction and various other garages, restaurants, and commercial spaces resting in the other direction. Pierson College blends in, and almost hides, within the surrounding urban landscape and can only be truly appreciated by those who can swipe into its secluded gates. (2)</span></p>','<p><span style="color: black;">Built and established in 1933, Pierson College has served as one of Yale’s primary residential colleges for the last eight decades. Prior to 1933, little is known about the actual ownership of the land which Pierson now occupies. The 1911 sanborn map shows the section in between Park Street and York Street as a collection of individual buildings, while the 1924 New Haven phonebook lists several names under the various Park Street addresses that have since come together to form Pierson College. (4) (5)</span></p><p><span style="color: black;"> </span></p><p><span style="color: black;">However, since 1933, Pierson College has served one function: residential college. The role of a residential college is multifaceted. A residential college is a collection of homes, a dining area, a multipurpose activity complex, a social space, a study space, and a microcosm of the Yale community as a whole. Pierson College is home to almost 500 undergraduate students as well as a dining hall, library, printing press, gym, buttery, and black box theater. (6)</span></p><p><span style="color: black;">Yale’s ownership of Pierson has drastically changed the social history of the area between Park and York Street over time. However, it is still a collection of living spaces, as it appeared to be in the 1911 sanborn map of New Haven. (4) Pierson still serves as a reminder. It is a reminder of the Southern, plantation style of architecture of the antebellum South. It is a reminder of the Georgian style of architecture, with its symmetrical brick facades and evenly dispersed buildings. (3) Yale University has transformed parts of New Haven, including where Pierson now stands. Pierson College carries that history with it, and is a reminder of Yale’s immense influence on the city.&nbsp;</span></p>','<p><span style="color: black;">The site where Pierson is now located was previously a collection of individually owned properties, as suggested by the 1911 sanborn map of New Haven along with the 1924 New Haven phonebook. (4) (5) These buildings were a combination of wood and masonry structures. Yale’s purchasing and building of Pierson drastically transformed that area of the city, as it did much of the city when the eight original residential colleges were built in 1933. It was William Harkness’ gift to the university that enabled the building of the eight original residential colleges, with those eight residential colleges remaining in place over eight decades later. After its yearlong renovation in 2004, Pierson now boasts Upper and Lower Court, two distinct living areas within its gates. This renovation also reconfigured the interior room layouts of the various buildings within Pierson.</span></p><p><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>','<p>(1) Pinell, Patrick. <em>Yale University: An Architectural Tour. </em>Princeton Architectural Press. 2013.</p><p><br></p><p>(2) Mills Brown, Elizabeth (1976). <em>New Haven, a Guide to Architecture and Urban Design. </em>New Haven: Yale University Press.</p><p><br></p><p>(3)&nbsp;“Georgian Style (1700-1830).” <em>Georgian Style Architecture Facts and History.

Of masonry and yellow brick, the highly decorative front façade displays an interesting play of forms, featuring rows of arched, rectilinear, and round windows and pilasters with Corinthianesque capitals. The façade also exhibits rich classical details, with cut egg and dart moldings, elaborate carvings, and a pressed-copper classical cornice with balustrade. A second cornice, of egg and dart moldings and acanthus leaf enrichments, divides the third and fourth levels. These exterior elements lend to an overall sense of grandeur and to a luxurious and elegant structural composition, an apt choice for the vintage and antiques shop occupying the building’s ground floor (15).</p><p>The single-story glass storefront is the result of a 2002 renovation by Robert Orr, who replaced a two-story false front from 1900 and saw the restoration of a dentil molding (16). Upon closer observation, this renovation is evident from the remnant breaks between the 2nd and 3rd stories of the façade.</p>','41.3058','<p>One block east of the New Haven Green, the English Building is in the middle of New Haven’s dense downtown business district, primarily comprised of well-preserved commercial buildings from the 19th and early 20th century.&nbsp;Located across the street from a cluttered empty lot converted into parking spaces and a major bus stop, the English Building is part of a row of three- to five- story structures of diverse storefronts. The bordering storefronts form a continuous façade with no setback from the sidewalk. There is light foot and regular car traffic on the adjacent section of Chapel Street. Walking down this strip of Chapel Street, a pedestrian encounters a close juxtaposition of many forms and styles, including “arcades of round-arched windows, elaborate bracketed Italianate cornices, Romanesque corbelling,” lending to a streetscape of diverse visual rhythm (17).</p>','<p>	The earliest known tenant of 837-839 Chapel Street was the McIntyre, Maguire, &amp; Co., a purveyor of dry goods in 1882 (18). The building itself was likely built around the 1860s, with the first drawing seen on an 1879 drawn map of the buildings of New Haven (19). The building has notably been mixed use throughout its history, housing a variety of insurance companies, architects, medical and law offices, orchestras, and real estate firms over time (see Past Tenants section). Notable historical occupants include the Loomis Temple of Music and Henry F. English, a lawyer who is the namesake for the present-day English Building and also for the last private home to be built on Hillhouse Avenue (20). English purchased the building at the end of the 19<sup>th </sup>century and added the original two-story false front in 1900 (21). 837 Chapel was home to the Loomis Temple of Music from 1890 until the mid 20<sup>th</sup> century (22).<sup>&nbsp;</sup>In the late 20<sup>th</sup> century, 837-839 Chapel housed a series of clothing stores, until Robert Orr purchased the building in 2002 and renovated it to the English Building that we see today (23). Present-day, the English Building has maintained its mixed-use history. It houses EBM Vintage New Haven on the first, Love146 on the second, Salon LuLu on the third, and Robert Orr &amp; Associates on the fourth floor.</p><p>	Much of the English Building’s social history is inextricable from the history of its location in the Ninth Square Historical District. The Ninth square was the southeast-most block of New Haven’s 17<sup>th</sup> century original design of nine half-mile-long squares (24). In the 17<sup>th</sup> to 19<sup>th</sup> centuries, the Ninth Square was a busy commercial area; its location by the harbor, the Farmington Canal, and the railroad designated it as a center of manufacturing and trade (25). Lending to its importance in New Haven civic life was its proximity to the Green, Yale University, and other government buildings (26). This high level of urban activity is illustrated in an image of New Haven in 1911 (see image of 1910 Chapel Street). However, after World War II in the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century, the Ninth Square and the rest of New Haven were affected from the movement of people to the suburbs (27). As a result, much of downtown New Haven was targeted for redevelopment in the 1950-60s; the Ninth Square was not redeveloped and became relatively run-down by the 1970-80s (28). With renewal efforts from the 1980s onwards, the appearance of many historic buildings has been restored and subsidized by the government (29). One of the largest concerns extending into today is that that the Ninth Square lacks the pedestrian traffic expected of a downtown neighborhood and has not attracted the anticipated level of commercial attention (30). This is reflected by the current owner of the English Building; in a 2012 article, Orr expressed, “All the store owners here are hopeful but anxious to see this area grow faster” (31).</p>','<p>In 1851, 837-839 Chapel Street did not yet exist, as the Wall Map of City of New Haven does not seem to include the structure. The block contains the Tontine Hotel, a bank, and several unidentified buildings in the area where 837-839 Chapel would eventually be located (32). The building is thought to be built sometime around the 1860s, with it possibly appearing on a map from 1879 (33). One of the earliest maps on which 837-839 is directly identified is the 1886 Sanborn Map, where the building is labelled among a row of long brick buildings bordering Chapel Street (34). From Sanborn maps over time, identiites of neighboring buildings have changed over time, ranging from commercial and retail stores to civic and public buildings (35).</p><p>Major renovations to the building have included the reconstruction of the front façade in 1900 to include a two-story false front, the addition of a glass storefront in 1945, and the most recent renovation around 2002 restoring much of the pre-1900 façade and installing a one-story false glass storefront (36, 37).</p>','<p>[1] New Haven Historic Resources Inventory, Phase I, Volume I: Essays and Methodology, (New Haven: The New Haven Preservation Trust, 1984), 103.</p><p>[2] Ibid.</p><p>[3] Greater New Haven Directory (New Haven: The Price &amp; Lee Co, 1890).</p><p>[4] New Haven Historic Resources Inventory, Phase I, Volume I: Essays and Methodology, 103.</p><p>[5] Greater New Haven Directory (New Haven: The Price &amp; Lee Co, 1915).</p><p>[6] Greater New Haven Directory (New Haven: The Price &amp; Lee Co, 1920).</p><p>[7] Greater New Haven Directory (New Haven: The Price &amp; Lee Co, 1927).</p><p>[8] Greater New Haven Directory (New Haven: The Price &amp; Lee Co, 1939).</p><p>[9] Greater New Haven Directory (New Haven: The Price &amp; Lee Co, 1944-45).</p><p>[10] Greater New Haven Directory (New Haven: The Price &amp; Lee Co, 1961).</p><p>[11] Greater New Haven Directory (New Haven: The Price &amp; Lee Co, 1970).</p><p>[12] Greater New Haven Directory (New Haven: The Price &amp; Lee Co, 1980).</p><p>[13] Greater New Haven Directory (New Haven: Hill – Donnelly Corporation, 1997).</p><p>[14] "Presents From The Past". 2012.&nbsp;Daily Nutmeg. http://dailynutmeg.com/2012/03/22/english-building-market-presents-from-the-past/.</p><p>[15] New Haven Historic Resources Inventory, Phase I, Volume I: Essays and Methodology, 103.</p><p>[16] "The English Building, New Haven, CT". 2018.&nbsp;Robert Orr + Associates.

Built in 1961 – the tail end of the postwar modernist and brutalist movements – this subdued structure offers an intriguing blend of cohesion and contrast to its more ornate neighbors to the south and north. It epitomizes the notion of function over form; save for a latticework grate adorning the staircase window and a metal awning covering the entrance, 246 Church features no other distinct ornamentations. The façade is covered in dark brickwork and concrete, with several thin columns emphasizing the verticality of this stoic edifice. Historically, the lot has seen several owners and at least three different structures. Today it hosts a variety of Yale administrative offices, including the university registrar, hospitality services, and financial aid.</p>','31,526 square feet','4, excluding basement','<p><em>Circa 1961:</em> Civic Reading Club; Clarence E.

It stands four stories high and is coated in deep brown brick, with thin columns of concrete occasionally dividing up the structure. Despite its somewhat diminutive size, the building places a surprising emphasis on its verticality; the area within direct view of the street has several asymmetrical tiers, including a protruding “tower” that contains both the elevator shaft and the main stairwell. While the whole building is lined with floor-to-roof windows, the tower’s window frames are uniquely lined by two thin columns of brick. These brick brackets add an extra dimension that quite literally juts out into the street, not unlike the columned facades of older schools of architectural design.</p><p><br></p><p>On the subject of design, 246 Church firmly falls within the camp of brutalism, a somewhat controversial style intended to craft powerful structures made of concrete slabs or hefty bricks. [3] Brutalist buildings are defined by their geometric designs, hardy structural elements, and classical proportions. This building features all three of these: the asymmetrical tower creates several cubical tiers at the roof; the remainder of the building is a sturdy, almost fortified space; and the concrete trim creates a column-like effect along the side of the façade. This has echoes of modernism as well, a reductionist movement defined by uneven composition, rectangular forms, flat rooves, and a near total lack of ornamentation. [4]</p><p><br></p>','<p>246 Church’s urban setting may be its most fascinating element. It is surrounded by other Yale-owned buildings, including the Woolsey House to the north, the Whitney Humanities Center to the south, and Timothy Dwight College to the west. Across the street to the west sit One Century Tower and the New Haven County Courthouse, two imposing structures that utterly dwarf 246 Church. With that said, the simple geometric design of this building makes it seem perfectly cohesive with any one of its neighbors while still standing out on its own right. </p><p><br></p><p>Looking down Church Street from the north, 246 seems perfectly in line with the brick chimneys of the Woolsey House; the elevator tower itself nearly takes the form of a chimney itself. Looking up Church Street from the south, 246 appears almost as an extension of the Whitney Humanities Center, their brick facades meshing together despite their technical separation. Even from the courtyard of Timothy Dwight College, the visible portion of 246’s brick façade seems to perfectly blend in with the college’s Federal style. This chameleonic quality defines the building, as its imposing self-identity can easily be molded to fit the context of neighboring structures.</p>','<p>The current building on 246 Church Street dates back to 1961, though both the architect and client commissioner for the building are unknown. Regardless, 246 Church was designed to fit perfectly within the existing narrow property lines; it was effectively sandwiched in by the Woolsey house immediately north and the Trinity Church Parish House directly to the south. [5]</p><p><br></p><p>Before the office building’s acquisition by Yale, it was home to a diverse array of businesses. The first tenants of 1961 included three accountants, two lawyers, and a family construction company. [6] By 1989, one of the final years the building was independently owned, it boasted a great number of lawyers, state offices, and even a few technology firms. [7] The tenant changes over those 28 years reflected a changing society, as the need for personal accountants faded in favor of technological experts in an era soon to be defined by the computer. Furthermore, the dramatic increase in law offices seems to reflect the increased demand for their services; given 246 Church’s close proximity to the New Haven County Court and the then-recently constructed Superior Court, it certainly seemed to be a prime spot for those in need of representation.</p><p><br></p><p>According to the New Haven Tax Assessor database, Yale formally purchased the building in 1986. [8] However, outside tenants were still occupying the offices as late as 1989, and student publications like the <em>Yale Daily News </em>made no mention of the space until 1992 at earliest. At this time, 246 Church Street had become home to the Office of Summer Programming and the Yale Press’s Design and Production department. [9] Over time, the office space grew into something of a hub of university activity. Despite its relative distance from the center of campus, the offices of 246 Church were renovated to include the university registrar, the financial aid office, the student employment office, and Yale Hospitality. </p><p><br></p><p>At some point in 246 Church’s history – likely after Yale’s acquisition – the main entrance shifted from the street to the south side of the building. Sanborn Company maps from 1973 lack the awning and handicap ramp that exist today; it is likely that Yale added these structures to better comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.[10] This would also account for the usage discrepancy between 1989 and 1992 – the building probably was undergoing renovations to better fit the needs and regulations of the university.</p>','<p>The site of 246 Church Street has a long history, dating as far back as the founding of the New Haven Colony. As a part of the original 9-square grid, the plot that would approximately become 246 Church was developed from the very start of the colonial experiment. The Brockett Map of 1641 shows the property split between three men: Richard Beckley, William Andrews, and John Cooper. [11] Over a century later, each of their properties had been acquired by the Cooper family, who held tight to a significant portion of the center-north square. The Wadsworth map of 1748 shows a small farmhouse or barn on the location that would eventually become 246 Church Street, the first of several structures that would define the space over time. [12]</p><p><br></p><p>The next known owner of the property was Richard F. Rand, an instructor at Yale and self-practicing physician. The house on 246 Church Street – now a dense residential space – served both as his dwelling and as his practice. [13] Sanborn maps from the era reveal a house much smaller than its neighbors, with a rather large shed sitting at the back of the narrow property. [14] Few photos exist of the property at this time, and those that so show only a small fraction of the household. Nevertheless, Richard Rand held onto the space for several decades until it was acquired for the construction of the new office building.</p><p><br></p>');

Composed of cement and tile, the building’s use of color with blue and white tile and bright yellow door inject life into a cold building, with the still present drive-thru teller window inviting questions to its historical past. Sitting on the corner of Park and George Street, the building and surrounding area disrupts the Victorian architecture of the greater Dwight Neighborhood, while also revealing how the built environment impacts the political, especially as a predominantly working-class, black area. </span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>','Bubbles & Squeak (1st Floor)/Unknown (2nd Floor)','50\'X40\'','2','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">1970/2 - 1983: Hartford National Bank and Trust</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">1983: Alcohol Services of South Central Connecticut </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">1984: Connecticut National Bank</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">1989-2003: Victorian Park Laundry</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">2001: Stewart Hutchings</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">2005-Present: Bubbles &amp; Squeak</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">~2008-2013: Experienced Movers and Storage </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">~2011 - unknown: Gaggle Office Space</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">~2012 - unknown: BZ Girls Studio </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">2015-2017: No Pop Studio Space</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">2017 - Present: Private Residence, tenant unknown </span></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In homage to its artistic re-appropriation, the most distinguishing feature is the bright pop yellow door, formerly even painted in the style of Piet Mondrian. The simple cubic form is slightly interrupted with an extension of the building, set back from the front facade, but still cohesive with tile exterior. Without ornamentation or additional space, the buildings supports the commercial and residential usage by allowing the function determine its significance, a clear example of modernist style (1). The building is composed of concrete and tile, with a load bearing masonry structural system (2). Estimated to be 50’ by 40’, the flat roofed building has two stories, which now create two spaces of distinct work (2). When facing the Park Street facade, a large parking lot sits on the left side. Reminiscent of its past as a bank, the building has a drive-thru teller window on the left side of the building. The transformation from a bank to laundromat shifted the interior design of the space, but allowing for new interpretations. In 1979, the building was covered with square pink tiles, which have now shifted to blue to match the exterior of Bubble &amp; Squeak (2). Windows adorn the Park Street facade, with bay window on 2nd floor and glass front on first floor. Though a rather recent building compared to the long history of New Haven architecture, the building begins to show signs of deterioration with graffiti, crumbling foundation, weathering and discoloration. </span></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The building sits in a mixed-use neighborhood on Park Street within the broader Dwight community. A large office building sits next door and Madison Towers, a large apartment complex, across the street, perhaps with some residents even using the laundromat. While quite close to the apartment building and within a dense urban landscape, the open space created by the parking lot distinguishes the building within the spatial dynamics of the street, opening up the building to the community. A few overgrown trees line the sidewalks and shrubbery fence in the parking lot, demarcating the space between public and private. Within this block on Park street sits contemporary buildings, unique given the more Victorian style of the Dwight neighborhood, seen even one block away. In 1979, historians noted that the then Hartford National Bank’s landscaped lot and well-kept appearance distinguished it from the “somewhat deteriorating surroundings.”(2) While problematic to divide the respectability of the bank from its surroundings through coded racial language, today, however, the building is beginning to match the surroundings, but stands out with the colorful front door. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The building reflects the convergence and tensions of the historic 19th century with postwar modern architecture. Thus, it is important to situate the building within these distinct discourses, especially with scholars aiming to draw attention to New Haven architectural importance. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Though distinct with its modern architecture, the building sits within the Historic Dwight Street neighborhood, known for its modest 19th and early 20th century structures, especially Victorian style. Since planned in the late 19th century, the grid design of this area remains a visible feature of the neighborhood, which also give the building clear sightlines on the block (3). Reflecting the working class background of the neighborhood, the houses are quite modest, wood-frame, single and two-family, constructed by workers who wanted to live near their employers or land speculators projecting the city’s expansion (3). Despite the depth of historical significance of this greater area, 130 Park St is not considered part of this historical culture given its young age, even seen as a “visual disrup[tion] to the 19th and early 20th century character of the area.” (3) With the rise of industry and manufacturing, the Dwight Street developed from a cluster of shacks for black workers to houses aligned to the grid, fueling urban development of primarily working-class homes (3). In the postwar era, the flight of upwardly mobile residents, especially white residents, shaped the district as poorer and more commercial (3). Within this narrative of Victorian historical preservation, the building is disregarded as one of “little outstanding architectural merit.” (3) However, this building has been reimagined through modernist discourse and contemporary re-appropriation of use. New Haven developed as an incubator for modernist architecture, spurred by the massive and ambitious urban renewal project, which also caused unnecessarily destruction (4). As modern becomes the past, New Haven’s modernist legacy should be remembered and preserved, but this building lends question to the interplay between the Victorian and Modern to nuance historical memory. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Though the CT Trust for Historic Preservation noted the building was built in 1960, only until 1972 is there mention of the Hartford National Bank within New Haven directories (5). From 1972 to 1983, the Hartford National Bank solely occupied the building, but was joined by the Alcohol Service of South Central Connecticut by 1983. After a merger in 1982, the building was renamed to Connecticut National Bank by 1984 (6). While Connecticut National Bank eventually merged to become the nationally known Bank of America in 2005, the history is unknown how this local bank location met its fate, as it is gone by the 1987 directory (5,7). Yet, the site’s history as a bank physically manifests in the challenging socio-economic realities of the neighborhood. With white flight and Dwight neighborhood developing as lower income and black, the role of the bank must be examined as an active player. Federal lending policies and redlining created structural barriers to financial resources towards primarily black communities, hindering the development of these area (8). Racism deeply embedded within these financial institutions, of which the Hartford National Bank cannot be excused, systematically continued black marginzation to ensure white supremacy, with the legacy still seen today, especially viewing this area as one of deterioration. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">With some reconfiguring of the internal space, the Victorian Park Laundromat appeared two year later, still retrofitted with the drive-thru teller, perhaps as a convenient way to pick up laundry (5). By 2005, the Laundromat undergoes a name change to Bubble and Squeak, with the same tenant and owner Stewart Hutchings, occupying the space since 2001 (5,9). With his name listed in the directory, Hutchings may have lived in the upstairs apartment, while running the business from the first floor.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">With each resident, the space has been repurposed and revitalized through community engagement, redeeming this building originally seen as insignificant. One of the oldest laundromats in New Haven, Bubbles &amp; Squeak invests into the community by providing free laundry days for homeless and needy populations organized through Trinity Church (10). During a site visit, the building was bustling with community residents and the staff showed clear attention to each guest. Beginning in 2015 until October, 2917, No Pop inhabited the space as an art studio focused on daily practice, led by artists Laura Marsh and Phil Lique, and hosted on the second floor. Mission to transform “ordinary and mundane into the illuminated and unexpected.” (11) Past exhibits are playful and thought provoking, engaging with space, place and community, like the “Fluxist Laundry Day” that envision artistic expression through the performance of laundry just downstairs (11). These community based interventions begin to redeem a building viewed as insignificant and repair its role to racial discrimination. </span></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Before the current building, the 1923 Sanborn maps shows that the site held a two-family brick and frame building, perhaps more aligned with the Victorian architecture of the Dwight neighborhood (12). By 1951, this building was demolished and in its place stood a concrete block building with plastered walls (13). By 1973, the building was extended slightly, becoming the current structure (14). The Sanborn maps and New Haven directories complicate this site history, with conflicting information on when the building was created, ranging from as early as 1950s to as late as 1970s. Regardless of exact date, the apparent newness of modernist architecture obscures the longer site history. </span></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">(1)- "A2 Modern | What Is Modern: Characteristics Of Modern Architecture". 2018.

New Haven’s 9th Square, located just southeast of the central Green, is a particularly dynamic site, and serves as an excellent litmus test for New Haven’s changing urban landscape. As a result, the Palladium Building has served a variety roles reflecting the ever-changing urban landscape around it. Today, it is a standard mixed-use commercial space, with storefronts on its ground floor and offices on its upper levels, although its upper stories are planned to undergo another change into upmarket apartments over the coming years. (2)</p>','75\' x 70\'','3','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Young Men’s Institute, New Haven Palladium, Home Insurance Company, James Hillhouse High School, Nicholas Furs.</span></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The original structure of the Palladium Building is a fairly standard model of the Renaissance Revival style, not exhibiting much of the whimsical eclecticism associated with Henry Austin, its most likely architect. (3) The three-story facade is unsurprisingly tripartite, fitting neatly into the timeless rusticated-base to </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">piano nobile</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> progression. The ground floor does vary slightly, with large windowed, quoin-framed bays to accommodate shop-fronts instead of the traditional solid, opaque composition. Today, wood and plaster extensions provide additional room for the shops on the ground floor, and almost entirely mask the base of the original building. The rest of the facade is fairly standard: the sides are lined with quoins in diminishing magnitude, pediments adorn each window, diminishing in scale in each level, and the overall composition is framed and divided by a series of ornamented brackets. In the center of the facade, a lavishly ornamented stone sign denotes the building’s current name. From the facade, the core of the building seems symmetrical: five bays of windows, with the main entrance centered, occupying a square footprint. However, a slightly later-built auxiliary wing to the building, a duplication of its two side bays, interferes with its idealized facade. (4) This disorienting effect made even more apparent by the jutting firewall left over after its neighboring buildings were demolished. (5) Over the last twenty years, an additional facade has been grafted onto the building’s rear as the building took on additional commercial uses: here, a triangular metal-and brick porch is attached, framing modern sliding electric doors. </span></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The current site of the Palladium Building bears little resemblance to any of the diverse sites that have surrounded the Palladium Building over the years. It remains on the busy urban intersection, and now stands directly above the Pitkin Street tunnel. Currently, it faces the current Young Men’s Institute to the West, an empty lot to the South, the fairly recently-christened Pitkin Plaza to the North, and the towering 360 State complex to the East. As a result, it is most predominantly a part of the wave of urban renewal projects centered around the new 360 State development. Pitkin Plaza is now a gathering spot for people who work in downtown, though most residents of downtown New Haven do not use the space.&nbsp;</span></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The now-Palladium Building was first built to host the Young Men’s Institute of New Haven, now housed across Orange Street. (6) However, no documents exist to explicitly state the building’s architect. As the style of the building is fairly standard, the spatial and social context of the building can narrow down its architect’s identity. Mills-Brown cites the building as Henry Austin’s handiwork due to its similarities to Henry Austin’s now-demolished Second-Empire style Tradesman’s Bank adjacent to it. On a greater geographic scale, this quarter of New Haven was densely saturated with Austin’s work. The Ninth Square lies only a block away from Wooster Square, which at that time contained Austin’s Governor English House (c. 1845), Willis Bristol House (c. 1845), and later the Oliver North House (c. 1865). As architects often operated on a community level during this period, such connections would favor the Palladium building as a product of Austin’s office. (7) O’Gorman also subscribes to this theory of social and community association: Austin’s apprentice Robert Hill was an alumnus of the Young Men’s Institute, and Austin’s later clients included members of the Institute’s board -- who also lived nearby. (8)</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Young Men’s Institute served as a hub of cultural education for the new urban working class. Originally founded in 1826 by mechanical apprentices, the Institute’s relevance grew rapidly along with New Haven’s industrial boom. (9) The Institute served as a stopgap measure in adult education, filling a civic void until the establishment of public libraries in 1887. While housing the Young Men’s Institute, the then-Institute Building hosted a variety of other educational facilities, including New Haven’s first public high school (now Hillhouse High). However, the Institute’s membership declined precariously in the economic slump following the Civil War, and the Institute Building changed hands a number of times through the 1860s and 1870s. (10)</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Eventually, the building came into the possession of another core civic institution, The New&nbsp;Haven Palladium newspaper. The New Haven Palladium ran starting from 1835, with changing circulations and publication schedules (alternating between combinations of daily, tri-weekly, and monthly formats) until the paper’s eventual liquidation in 1901. (11) From the mailing address listed on the Palladium, the move into the Palladium Building took place somewhere between 1863 and </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">1886: (12) it was also during this period that the auxiliary wing to the building was constructed to contain a print shop. Previously, the Palladium offices were located at the nearby Adelphi Building, which has been replaced by the State Street Train Station.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">After the end of The Palladium’s occupancy, the building remained vacant until for the majority of the 20th century. (14) Eventually, it was bought up by the city and slated for demolition, before a mixture of public opinion and private investment led to a restoration in 1981. (15) Since then, it has changed hands a considerable number of times: currently, its occupants include Tikkaway Grill, G Cafe, and The Devil’s Gear. It is currently owned by New-Haven based NHR Group. </span></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">At its construction in 1855, the most direct context for the Palladium Building was the eclectic Greek-Revival Phoenix Building located across Chapel Street, which was the previous home of the Young Men’s Institute. (16) The following year, Henry Austin’s Second-Empire style Tradesman’s Bank was constructed directly adjacent to the Palladium Building. (17) These buildings, joined orthogonally, created a small alley connecting Orange Street with Union Street. By 1901, the Tradesman’s Bank was vacated, and the rest of the block was dominated by the Howe and Stetson Department Store. During this span, the alley between Orange and Union had widened into a small road: Pitkin Street. (18) By 1924, the Palladium Building was likewise vacant. The Tradesman’s Bank and seemingly every remaining inch of the block had been encompassed by the Howe and Stetson, which had then changed hands to become the Shartenberg &amp; Robinson Co. Department Store. By 1973, the rest of the block, save for the still-vacant Palladium building had been demolished for parking. Pitkin Street remained, now as a wide traffic thoroughfare. (19) This metamorphosis reflected New Haven’s change into a commuter city, as this site stood only a few blocks away from I-95’s ramps.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The formal redevelopment of the Palladium Building’s site began with its 1981 restoration: by this time, Pitkin Street had been moved underground, forming the Pitkin Tunnel. In this new space, Pitkin Plaza was constructed in 1983. (20) In conjunction with the tunnel and plaza, a series of brick towers were erected both as ventilation for the tunnel below, and as decorations for the </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">plaza. (21) In 2008, the parking space that replaced the Shartenberg &amp; Robinson Store was replaced by the 360 State Street development, marking a massive investment in revitalizing the Ninth Square. </span></p>','<p>(1) “Ninth Square Historic District,” The New Haven Preservation Trust, accessed Jan. 31, 2018.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>(2) “Palladium Building,” The NHR Development Group, accessed Feb. 20, 2018.</p><p><br></p><p>(3)&nbsp;Elizabeth Mills Brown, New Haven: A Guide to Architecture and Urban Design (New Haven: Yale UP, 1976), 118.</p><p><br></p><p>(4) James F.

The simultaneously neo-Gothic and Georgian architectural styles of the building allow it to blend well into the design of many other residential areas of Yale University, though the peculiar insides of the power plant stick out of the top, revealing that this is not a typical university building. In this way, the building reads akin to a series of beautiful high walls that are concealing the on-goings within. Additionally, with its monumental size and stature, two tall smokestack towers, and the gated entrance, the building mimics a sort of fortress, exuding a strong sense of power. This is of upmost importance because the building itself is a source of power, providing about half of the Yale campus with electricity, steam heat and chilled water (1). In accord with the University’s sustainability initiatives, the power plant uses a cogeneration technique to generate power, allowing for significant energy efficiency (2). This plant was built in 1918 by Day &amp; Klauder (4), and has reliably provided many buildings on campus with electricity and heat ever since (2).&nbsp;</p>','3','<p>Yale University: 1918-Present&nbsp;</p>','<p>The Central Power Plant is composed of brick with limestone trim (9), many glass windows, a flat, concrete roof and various industrial components likely made out of steel for the purpose of generating energy. The architecture of this power plant defies the typical cylindrical, concrete structure that one normally associates with the ugly process of burning fossil fuels and natural gas. Instead, this building beautifully reflects the architectural styles found around Yale’s campus; the arches at the entrance, the large, gated openings, and the two tall smokestack towers represent the Collegiate Gothic/Gothic Revival style employed by James Gamble Rogers in some of the residential colleges, while the brick walls reflect the Georgian architecture displayed in others. Despite this effort to hide the industrial structures critical to the identity of a power plant, the architect allows for clear visibility of a small portion of these </p><p>steel structures out of the top of the building. Furthermore, the building appears to be a massing of brick walls serving to hide the inside. One may hypothesize that this is the case in order to hint to the community that the building is not a typical Yale building, and that there is something interesting, though somewhat secretive and concealed, going on inside. </p><p><br></p><p>Additionally, the massive size of the building – in terms of both height and width – allude to the importance of the structure on campus. The Central Power Plant has achieved this size following two expansion projects, necessary to generate the large amount of energy needed to supply the campus. One addition was facilitated by architect Michael Raso (6), and the other, known as “Yale’s Central Power Plant Boiler Expansion project,” was carried out by Charney Architects, LLC (7). The latter required reforming the Yale Service Bureau building so as to house the new boilers, the creation of a new control room, and the renovation of some of the interior of the plant (7).&nbsp;</p>','<p>Until 2017, the power plant sat on the outskirts of campus, across from Morse College and along the street that leads to athletic facilities such as Payne Whitney Gym and Ray Tompkins Center. These nearby university buildings, however, do not portray the same Gothic Revival or Georgian architecture that define the style of many buildings at Yale. In this way, the Central Power Plant brings the collegiate feel to the outer region of campus, helping to delineate an almost invisible border that separates Yale from the rest of New Haven. </p><p><br></p><p>Following the recent addition of the new colleges, however, the power plant’s location is now considered to be close to the center of campus. With its two tall smokestack towers and grand stature now closer to the middle of campus, the importance of the building is particularly evident. On the other hand, the Grove Street Cemetery sits on the other side of the building. Typically, cemeteries and power plants, which are related to death and pollution, respectively, are not the central focus of universities; it could be hypothesized that this is why their original locations existed towards the outskirts of campus. As follows, it would be interesting to hear Yale University’s opinion on the location of the power plant (and cemetery) following the recent shift in campus centrality. </p><p><br></p><p>Regardless of the location of the center of Yale campus, the streetscape has remained more or less the same since the addition of the new colleges. This area is currently very hectic, as the large building next door is under construction. Between the height of the smokestack towers that are a part of the power plant, and the height of Morse college, the buildings seem to almost funnel one’s attention down Tower Parkway to the monumental, church-like building that is Payne Whitney Gym at the end of the road. A significant amount of traffic exists in this area, with cars speeding along Tower Parkway, and many buses often stopping outside the gym. There are a few sparse trees lining the road, but this region mainly brings a visitor’s focus to the large buildings, impressive architecture and hustle-and-bustle of city life.</p>','<p>The Central Power Plant was originally created by Yale University, for the University, with the intention of providing energy to about half of the buildings on campus. More specifically, the plant generates electricity, steam heat and chilled water (2). As part of an ever-progressive university, it is likely that this building plays a significant role with regard to sustainability at Yale. At first, the power plant was built to burn coal, though this technique was quickly replaced with the more efficient and environmentally friendly process of cogeneration (2). Technically speaking, cogeneration uses natural gas (cleaner than coal) to generate electricity; at the same time, it also captures the heat that would typically be lost in this process and uses it for heating and/or cooling purposes (10), by distributing the steam and chilled water through interconnected pipes that link to many of the structures on campus (11). At full capacity, the power plant can produce a very large amount of power - exactly 18 megawatts of electricity and 340,000 pounds of steam per hour for the purpose of heating (11). The power plant has been expanded a few different times so that it can produce more energy for the growing campus. Unfortunately, even in the case of cogeneration, producing energy by means of natural gas emits carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, thus contributing to global warming and climate change (12). This is an important social and environmental issue to consider, because carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have been increasing substantially, along with energy use, in recent history. Nonetheless, Yale’s Sustainability program is continuously working on combatting this issue; by focusing on individual conservation projects, Yale was able to reduce such emissions by 0.2% from 2016 to 2017, despite a growing campus (13). </p><p><br></p><p>Another aspect of the social history of this power plant revolves around the topic of dangerous working conditions. In October of 2015, a man working at the Central Power Plant fell 40 feet off of a ladder as he was doing repair work on a chimney. He was then stuck in the smokestack for about an hour until the New Haven Fire Department retrieved him. Unfortunately, he later passed away in the hospital. Later, everyone affiliated with the university received an email from Yale, with a statement offering condolences and support to anyone affected by the news (14). This event definitely brought a feeling of terror to the community regarding the dangers of the Central Power Plant. The area, combined with the pollution from the plant and the cemetery next door, may exude a sort of ominous vibe to some. At the same time, however, the statement sent to the Yale population may have worked to show the support that the school has for everyone associated with the university, including students, professors and facility workers. This creates the sense that everyone is a part of the Yale community, as is further reflected by the architecture of the power plant, which closely resembles the style of many other buildings on campus.&nbsp;</p>','<p>In 1901, the Central Power Plant did not yet exist, as two buildings - the Hebrew Ladies Orphan Society and the New Haven Wheel Company - stood in in the exact location that the Central Power Plant stands today (3). These buildings originally sat in a broader region known as the York Square area (3). York Square was created in 1836 and was comprised of a row of Greek Revival residential buildings and a 500-foot long, rectangular Green (4). In 1894, however, York Square was slowly demolished by New Haven and Yale University (5). Along with these changes, the Hebrew Ladies Orphan Society and New Haven Wheel Company buildings were destroyed and replaced by a Commercial High School, the Central Power Plant and the Yale Service Bureau building (15).</p><p><br></p><p>The Central Power Plant was built in 1918 by Day &amp; Klauder, funded by Mrs. Stephen V. Harkness (9) for the purpose of providing heat and electricity to about 50% of the buildings on campus (5). Nine years later, in 1926, Tower Parkway was constructed through the middle of what used to be York Square, giving the power plant its current address of 120 Tower Parkway. This street leads to what would later become Payne Whitney Gym, and brought more traffic through the area (4). As seen in the Sanborn map of 1973, the High School next to the Power Plant was demolished (16). Since this time, the Central Power Plant has been a part of two expansion projects, thus taking over the Yale Service Bureau building and growing much larger (7). Additionally, the plant now sits next to another Yale building, previously known as “Swing Space,” which is currently under construction for the purpose of housing graduate students at the Law School (8).&nbsp;</p>','<ol><li>“Energy" A Peoples Guide to Infrastructure in New Haven. 2015.

The centrally located, campus apartments border Yale University’s Davenport and Pierson Colleges, walking distance from the main shopping and restaurant districts in New Haven.&nbsp;</p>','4','72ft by 72ft  by 36ft by 36ft','<p class="ql-align-justify">On the corner of Park Street and Edgewood Ave, a four-story brick apartment complex sits near the street facing sides of the property. The entire exterior façade features intricate brick masonry, which illustrates an influence of Colonial/Gorgonian architecture in the material construction. However, the design of the building references classical architecture through the symmetricity of the building’s windows and the tiered molding along the flat roof. The molding ornament at the edge of the roof resembles that of a Doric column capital. According to National Historical Records, the description of the buildings originally featured a shed roof, but the building underwent renovations resulting in the flat roof seen today (11). Records of the renovation were not accessible. The bricks on the building’s exterior are laid horizontally for most of the facade, except in cases where they are used to emulate neoclassical arches around the building’s many windows. These abstracted windows are squared instead of arched, but the architect highlights the place of the keystone by coloring it white above the window frame, which clearly references Romanesque archways and neoclassical architecture. The brick façade falls flat on the streetscape apart from the four window bays, which create a large, column-like protrusion to the right of the Dinmore doorway. This protrusion allows an expansion of interior apartment space and the possibility of more light from the windows. On the façade facing Park Street, the Dinmore doorway is off-set to the left lower side of the building. It emulates a post and lintel archway with carved fluting like that seen in an Ionic column. The gray concrete of the door frame juxtaposes the entrance to the Dinmore apartment building against the rest of the red brick façade. In comparison, the Edgewood exterior of the building mirrors that of the Dinmore side with the addition of a terra cotta frieze relief of bundled acanthus leaves (11). The rear exterior facing away from the street features three different partially enclosed porch stairwells. These wood framed stairwells are completely attached to the apartment complex.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>','<p>George T. Newhall\'s Carriage Company, Apartment and Realty Company, Elm Campus Partners. Variety of individuals renting from realty companies throughout the 20th century, most being Yale Undergraduate students. </p>','<p class="ql-align-justify">	The flat brick facade of 228 Park St. connects to two other buildings, which form a larger V-shaped apartment complex. The entire complex has two designated addresses: 224-228 Park St. and 8-10 Edgewood Ave (3). Resting in a densely populated district, the apartment complex is the only brick building among five other residential housing units on the street. Today, the building provides residential off-campus housing for mostly undergraduate students of Yale University with its convenient location and proximity to the main university facilities (3). The east side of Park Street is completely taken up by two of Yale’s Residential Colleges and other arts-affiliated University-owned buildings. In contrast, the west side of Park Street accommodates many apartment and residential units somewhat smaller than 228 Park Street along with St. Thomas Moore, one of the main Catholic Churches in New Haven, and three commercially zoned restaurants properties: Dunkin Donuts, Tarry Lodge, and Box63 Bar and Grill.</p><p><br></p>','<p class="ql-align-justify">	The present-day site of the Dinmore-Orleton Court-Eton Hall building was not always home to an apartment complex. The lot has always functioned as a commercially zoned property ever since Park Street and Martin Street (Edgewood Ave.) were paved through the original Chapel-Howe-Elm-York Street grid during the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century. Before the commercial apartment complex seen today, the property housed George T. Newhall’s Carriage Company and factory from the 1840s until the turn of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. </p><p class="ql-align-justify">	George T. Newhall was one of the leaders in the manufacturing of carriages in New Haven. Newhall learned the art of carriage making at another factory called Hooker and Osborne, which was also once located further down on Park Street (9). He started his own business down the street shortly after at 228 Park Street and continued working in the carriage business for over forty years. Newhall soon observed the used of steam power while visiting other carriage factories in Providence, RI and revolutionized the New Haven carriage industry by introducing the technology in the late 19th century (1). Steam power was a more cost-effective and productive way to power the machines involved in constructing the carriages (1). Four other privately owned carriage companies surrounded Newall’s factory on the corner of Park Street and Martin Street (Edgewood Ave. today) as seen in the Sanborn Map illustrations from 1886 (5). In the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, Park Street boomed with industrial companies involved in the carriage production business. Newhall later purchased an old mill on the Farmington Cancel and moved his business away from the central urban space of New Haven (9). He eventually relocated his entire business completely north of the original factory property to an area eventually deemed “Newhallville,” in honor of the prominent businessman (9). Significant population growth during the 1890s and a large influx of European immigrants caused most factories and industrial business to be pushed farther away from the central nine square grid of the original New Haven town layout. In 1880, when Newhall’s carriage company still operated at 228 Park St, there were around sixty thousand residents in New Haven, but by 1890, the population had already increased to eighty thousand (1). After the demolition of the Park Street factory in 1900, no other building inhabited the site before the 1910 construction of the apartment complex (6). The year 1900 also saw record numbers of New Haven residents as the population surpassed a hundred thousand citizens (1).</p><p class="ql-align-justify">	In the period from 1870 to 1930, private entrepreneurs built nearly two hundred apartments in New Haven (1). Built in 1910, 228 Park St. represents one of these apartment complexes. At the time the Dinmore was constructed in 1910, the Civic Improvement Report from that very same year disclosed that there were 133,605 residents of New Haven (1).&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the construction of new apartment buildings does not directly translate from steep population growth, these densely populated urban areas soon required more housing for citizen, especially the booming undergraduate population of Yale University (1). A large pattern toward off-campus living between 1887-1899 lead to an increase in the construction of high end multiple dwelling buildings that catered to undergraduates with proximity to campus life and University buildings (1). At the turn of the century, there was also an increase in the prevalence of real estate developers and construction companies in New Haven (1). The Orleton Court Apartment and Realty Company, one of many privately owned realty companies, purchased the site between in the first years of the 20<sup>th</sup> century and eventually constructed the apartment complex as it stands today in 1910 (1). No architect exists in record (1). </p><p class="ql-align-justify">	After 1900, the ownership of the Orleton Court-Dinmore-Eton Hall complex always has fallen into the hands of privately owned realty companies. The apartments have been rented to a variety of Yale University undergraduate students over the years who represent “the perfect renter pool for nigh-end multiple dwellings” (1). According to current tenant records, the nine apartments that are part of the Dinmore building house a variety of individuals and groups of undergraduates, most of whom attend Yale University. Elm Campus Partners LLC, a Yale-owned property management company founded in 2002, now owns the property and rents out the individual apartments on an annual basis (3). </p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>','<p class="ql-align-justify">	The 1824 gridded map of New Haven shows that Park St. and Edgewood Ave. (formerly Martin St.) had yet to be paved through the grid square created by Elm Street, York Street, Howe Street, and Chapel Street (2). On the included 1824 New Haven map, the red star marks the approximated location of where the apartment complex at 228 Park Street would eventually be built (2). Before the complex at 224-228 Park and 8-10 Edgewood was constructed in 1910, the property housed the George T. Newhall Carriage Company for most of the 19th century. The Sanborn map of 1886 illustrates the presence of Newhall’s company on the corner of Park Street and Edgewood Street (5). The factories were later destroyed after Newhall’s company relocated to new property further away from the center of New Haven, apparent in the 1901 Sanborn map (6). Cassius Kelly’s 1911 <em>Atlas of New Haven</em> is the first archival resource that depicts the Dinmore-Orleton Court-Eton Hall apartment complex as it exists today on the commercially zoned property (4, 10). Both the 1924 and 1973 Sanborn maps solidify that the apartment complex has remained the same standing on the corner of Edgewood Avenue and Park Street for the last hundred years even though management and occupation has shifted (7,8).&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>','<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liu, Emily, "The Creation of Urban Homes: Apartment Buildings in New Haven, 1890-1930" (2006).

Built with Indiana limestone, the building conserves its original color as it has been well maintained. Its façade contains clear elements of classical architecture with its Greek columns, and is a clear break from previous Gothic buildings on campus. The structure commemorates Yale’s 200th anniversary along with the University’s founders, especially Reverend Timothy Woodbridge. Since it has served as the administration’s home for the last century, the building has also been the sight of some of the most important student protests on campus.&nbsp;</p>','80 ft. by 45 ft.; approximately 10,800 sq. ft.','3','<p><br></p>','<p>Building is located at the heart of Yale’s campus and is a daily sight for most students.&nbsp;</p>','<p>	The neoclassical administrative building has two floors and a basement. It was built with Indiana limestone that has been conserved well over time and maintains its whiteness that “shocked oldtimers” when it was built (5). Its ties to classical antiquity are clear, with Greek columns on every side. The building has a flat slate roof that is framed with a balcony. Its front and two sides contain the names of the other nine founders of Yale College just below the cornice. Its rear contains an inscription from <em>The Aeneid </em>referring to its founders, which translates to “They enabled life through the arts and made others mindful of them”. In addition, an ornamentation on its north side commemorates Yale’s 200th anniversary, while another ornamentation on its south side celebrates the University’s founding in 1701. The building’s outward appearance has remained relatively constant throughout its history, conserving its original appearance. One notable change has been its rear, which now has a wheelchair accessible entrance (9). In its interior, the wall’s hang portraits of Yale presidents and its first patron, Elihu Yale. Its iron stairs were designed with Italian Renaissance influences and its doors and mantles were taken from demolished houses in New York (13). In addition, stained-glass windows in its landing commemorate John Haynes, first Governor of Connecticut, and George Wyllys, Governor of Connecticut in 1642 (6). Its landing also contains a statue of Nathan Hale, America’s first spy and martyr. (13) Finally, within the Corporation Room, each fellow has a chair marked with his name on a brass tablet. When a fellow retires, he receives the chair as a gift for his dedication to the institution (6).&nbsp;</p>','<p>Since it was built in 1901, Woodbridge Hall has been home to Yale’s administration and Yale Corporation meeting room. Along with Woolsey Hall, the University Dining Hall, and Memorial Hall, these buildings were commissioned in order to celebrate the 200th anniversary of Yale (7). The Bicentennial Buildings, as they are known collectively, broke from previous Gothic architecture on Campus with their Beaux-Arts Classicism (5). With its new location, the administration wanted to show that it served the university as a whole, and that it was equally focused on the arts and the sciences.&nbsp;At the beginning of the 20th Century, Yale’s governing body was focused on creating a new area on campus that provided essential university services and would connect its liberal arts and science campuses.</p><p>The building was a gift from Olivia and Caroline Phelps Stokes, who were the aunts of Anson Phelps Stokes, Yale’s secretary at the time (6). The sisters from New York City agreed to donate the building under certain conditions, which included that Anson’s architect brother, Isaac Newton Phelps Stokes, had to design it and that it had to be named after their ancestors, which included Reverend Timothy Woodbridge, John Haynes, and George Wyllys (10). The building ended up being designed by Howell &amp; Stokes, a New York based firm led by Phelps Stokes and his partner John Mead Howells.&nbsp;Ultimately, the building was named after Woodbridge, who was one of the founders of Yale College and its trustee from 1701 to 1732. Ironically, Woodbridge was also a Hartford minister that was very opposed to Yale’s move to New Haven and instead wanted it to relocate to Hartford. His opposition was so great that he held a separate commencement in Hartford in 1718(10). Nevertheless, he eventually conceded to Yale’s move to New Haven and remained a trustee until his death in 1732.</p><p>Although Woodbridge Hall greatly differed from many of the Gothic buildings on campus, its architects clearly drew parallels to another building that was important on Yale’s campus. Built in 1832, the Trumbull Gallery was the first art museum at an educational institution in the United States (12). In 1868, the building was remodeled by adding windows and it became the Treasury, which was home to Yale’s administration prior to Woodbridge Hall. Although the Trumbull Gallery was demolished, this new French Renaissance-styled mansion can be seen as a more ornate reincarnation of the historic art building (11).</p><p>Woodbridge Hall has always housed the President’s Office and Corporation Room, but it has also held other roles throughout Yale’s history. At one moment in time, the building contained all of the university’s administrative functions. Some of these included student records, financial services, and keeping tuition money in the structure’s vault, which has now been repurposed (13).&nbsp;</p><p>Since Woodbridge Hall has been home to Office of the President and the Corporation Room, its image has always been very closely tied to that of the administration. When the University President sends routine communications to the student body, these are referred to as Notes from Woodbridge Hall, further emphasizing the connection. As a result, any protest in which students disagree with the administration’s stance or decision will likely take place in front of Woodbridge Hall. These have included protests against the naming of the new residential colleges in 2016, divestment from fossil fuels in 2015, and divestment from companies doing business in South Africa in the 1980s to name a few. Therefore, this administrative building has been to the sight of some of the most heated and intense debates on campus over the last century. As long as Woodbridge Hall remains the home of the school’s governing body, such manifestations will continue to occur there in order for the student body to demonstrate its views.</p><p>Due to the construction of the Schwartzman Center, the University’s administration will be temporarily relocated in August 2018 to Sheffield-Sterling-Strathcona Hall, where the Yale College Dean’s Office currently is. They plan to return in 2020 when construction is completed.&nbsp;According to Vice President for Communications Eileen O’Connor, the last time the administration had to relocate from Woodbridge Hall was during Richard Levin’s presidency for the construction of Beinecke Plaza (8).&nbsp;</p>','<p>Prior to Woodbridge Hall, this land was not owned by Yale. As seen on Reuben Holden’s <em>Yale: a pictorial history</em>, this plot was acquired by Yale during one of its expansions at the beginning of the 20th century (7). Prior to that, it is likely to land was used to for student housing. At the time, many students lived in off campus dwellings on Wall Street. This is further confirmed by a 1900 image from the Dana Collection, which looks towards 105 Wall Street, showing row houses along the street. Since the New Haven directories did not include addresses prior to 1900, it was difficult to determine who exactly lived in the location before it was acquired by Yale. </p><p>Historically, the address was first developed at some moment between 1812 and 1824. In the Doolittle Map of 1812 (2), Wall Street already existed, but it had not reached College Street and 105 Wall Street did not exist. By the Doolittle Map of 1824 (3), Wall Street had been continued and there seems to be a structure at 105 Wall Street, which remained there in the 1851 Collins and Clark Map (4) and the 1886 Sanborn Map (1).&nbsp;</p>','<ol><li>Sanborn-Ferris Map Co., Insurance Maps of New Haven, Connecticut Volume 2, 1886, 3. </li><li>Doolittle Map of 1812 </li><li>Doolittle Map of 1824 </li><li>Collins &amp; Clark, Map of the City of New Haven and Vicinity, 1851. </li><li>Brown, Elizabeth Mills . <em>New Haven: A Guide to Architecture and Urban Design</em>.

The ADPhi Chapter left Yale in 1935, only 4 years after 215 was built, and sold the building to Yale. In the years following, the building has been host to a multitude of departments and organizations, but has yet to return to its original purpose.</p>','Alpha Delta Phi Fraternity','2 1/2 + A + B','85x45\'','<p>The Alpha Delta Phi Fraternity were the first tenants to inhabit 215 Park starting in 1931, and because of this, the building was designed primarily for this purpose. James Gamble Rogers incorporated a spacious basement, a second floor meeting room with room for 80, as well as a stage, changing rooms, and a billiard room into the fraternity’s design. Fraternities at Yale during this time served a similar purpose to residential colleges —students lived together and dined together in these small communities—however, fraternities began to disappear at Yale as the residential college system was introduced in the 1930s. As a result, in 1935, ADPhi sold 215 Park to Yale and the chapter left the university.</p>','<p>When entering from York Street through the slim, red bricked archway that connects the two adjacent buildings like a small crease, the sidewalk opens up into what feels like a glimpse into a Yale of the past. The meandering sidewalk that guides through what was once a row of fraternities appears almost like a small, suburban neighborhood nestled within an urban city. With other buildings facing the traffic of the city, lining the streets in straight rows and stapled by sidewalks, the urbanism that surrounds this hidden space appears to be incapable of infiltrating from any side. The Rudolph Center’s hard brutalism brackets Frat Row on one side while the multistory architecture of the Hotel Duncan and “The Study” rise from behind 215 Park, making the series of Tudor Revival buildings feel closed in like a courtyard. But rather than feeling boxed in by the towering architecture surrounding, Frat Row feels more like an opening into a piece of New Haven that offers view into the past.</p>','<p>Since Alpha Delta Phi sold the building to Yale in 1935, Yale has used the space for numerous university affiliated organizations, departments, and programs. The Yale Political Union exclusively used the building until 1943, when the Far Eastern Language Department began using 215 Park as offices. Until 1980, the YPU continued to use 215 Park despite other departments also using the space. Until 1976, the building belonged to the Language Department, which later became the “Career Advisory and Placement Service” until 1980. The building was vacant for less than a year until Yale decided to use the building for art studio spaces until 1989. Yale then replaced this with the Women’s Liberation Group and spaces for the YPU, who returned in 1989. Today, 215 Park contains offices for the History of Art Department.</p>','<p>Sanborn Maps show that the land where 215 was built was an empty plot of land in 1886. In 1901, they show a small unmarked and unnumbered building which continues to appear in 1924, but without further explanation into its use or design beyond its small, rectangular form. In 1973, Sanborn Maps begin to show 215 Park Street, which was used as the School of Language at this time.</p>','<p>215 Park Street sits in a small, landscaped lot with a horizontal red brick facade and Tudor Revival style that appears modest but still maintains a reference to Mock Tudor. 215 Park connects to the sidewalk with a large, wooden door framed by a squared sandstone archway. The door is stacked by a mullioned window that emphasizes its style, while the windows on each side of the perturbing foyer are simple and rectangular. On each side of the door are walls extending out and curving into the end of the building to allow for the basement level to have windows into the small lowered platforms covered in ivy. Two remodels of the interior space have occurred: one in 1964, funded by the Yale Political Union, and one in 1989 funded by Yale.</p>');

Remodeling converted the row into one continuous property under the singular address 548 Orange St.</p><p>  </p>','<p>Before the building’s remodeling in 1915, this address was a part of identical, Second Empire style, brick row houses with French influences. They all fell under one continuous, mansard style, slate roof. Each individual house featured intricate molds along the large arched windows. The entryway to each house had double-paneled doors, which were directly below arched canopies supported by the porch floor and engaged piers. The front doors were above street level, which included their own raised porch and set of stairs that could be accessed directly from Orange Street. The railings leading up to the front doors were made of cast iron. Short blocks of row houses were sporadic in distribution throughout New Haven, and this structure stood out amongst the other neighboring buildings. </p><p><br></p><p>The remodeling was for the purpose of apartment housing, which led to the erasure of the four distinct addresses. Now the wood frame is reinforced by load-bearing masonry. The present-day design no longer takes on the original Second Empire style, but contains Georgian style influences. The roof is now flat roll asphalt; the previous attic space that existed above the third floor has been extended into a complete fourth floor.&nbsp;</p>','<p>The Belnord apartment building is nestled between a highly populated residential area of East Rock on the eastern end of Orange Street. Along the street are other late 19<sup>th</sup> century buildings of various styles, where a few of which have since then been remodeled. Its proximity to the Yale School of Management make for ideal commute times. There are also numerous restaurants and retail establishments close by who cater to the young-adult social scene. The Belnord is directly in front of the New Haven Lawn Club, partially serving as a privacy wall from the main street to obscure views of the tennis courts and swimming pool. The building does not particularly stand out from the other Orange street buildings, however it is one of the larger structures on the block and in surrounding areas. An exact replicate of the original 1868 brick row houses still stands directly on the other side of the street.</p>','<p>Since 1915, The Belnord has served as apartment housing. Yale College graduate, Jacob Weinstein, designed the building, so this suggests to some extent that the type of tenant residing in this building stayed for the purpose of attending the nearby university and was of similar background as Weinstein, considering Yale’s lack of women and people of color. The original rows of houses were home to Augustus D. Hendrick, a clock maker, as well as Viking Realty, a real estate broker’s office. This may suggest that this block was some sort of quasi residential-commercial area with neighboring, small businesses along the entire block and along the rest of the eastern end of Orange Street.&nbsp;</p>','<p>This block originally existed as a row of four brick houses, erected in 1868-69 by Nelson Newgeon. It was historically known as the Nelson C. Newgeon Block until 1915, when Sheffield Scientific School graduate, Jacob Weinstein, constructed newer and more attractive apartment housing presently known as The Belnord.&nbsp;</p>','<p>Modern Connecticut homes and homecrafts; a book of representative houses, interiors, gardens, decorations, furnishings and equipment appropriately described and illustrated by several hundred beautiful engravings.

The two-story brick home sits on a raised basement and has a temple-front façade, a gabled roof, and a cream-colored pediment enclosing an arch window. The six ionic pilasters on the Church Street façade have cracked and faded due to weathering. The eastern façade is more subdued and is defined by a classical entry porch supported by two Corinthian columns. Originally built in 1841 as a simple Greek Revival style home for Yale President Theodore Dwight Woolsey, the building was enlarged and given its contemporary façade in 1906 under the direction of architect Richard Clipston Sturgis. (1,2). Yale purchased the building in 1935, added storefront windows to the raised basement and converted the interior into commercial offices (3).&nbsp;</p>','<p>This two story neoclassical mansion is laid out symmetrically, built from brick and stone, sits on a raised basement with storefront windows, and has a gabled roof perpendicular to Church Street. The home is seven bays wide. (1) The Church Street façade has six fluted ionic pilasters, four of which are located centrally to create a temple front. Immediately above the pilasters is a bracketed cornice and pediment that encloses an arch window. The eastern façade is less intricately detailed and its defining feature is a Greek Revival style entry porch with simple entablature supported by two Corinthian columns. </p><p><br></p><p>This blend of styles is a result of the building’s major redesign between 1901 and 1906, which was overseen by the notable New England architect Richard Clipston Sturgis. He admired the neoclassical form, especially the work of Bulfinch (4). Before the renovation, the building was a simple, charming Greek Revival brick home with a pair of chimneys on either side of the home (one chimney on the eastern façade was removed during the renovations, the other three remain) (1). The building connected to Church Street via a short pathway that led up to an entry porch supported by two rounded columns—similar to the entry porch that now defines the eastern façade (5). The expansion of the home and the addition of the pilasters, cornice, and pediment gave the building a more commanding and almost monumental presence on Church Street and told passers-by that members of one of Yale’s most important families resided there.&nbsp;</p>','10,681 sq ft','3','<p>The Woolsey House is located just one block north of the New Haven Green in the center of New Haven’s downtown district—across from New Haven Superior Court and the Fidelity Investments building. It is one of the only residential-style buildings in the city’s bustling civic and commercial hub.&nbsp;</p>','<p>Theodore Dwight Woolsey and his family were the home’s first occupants after the construction was finished in 1841. As the 1888 New Haven Atlas shows, at that time, the neighborhood was an elite residential district populated by professionals and professors (6). Woolsey, a Professor of Greek, was appointed Yale College’s President in 1846. Known as a strict disciplinarian, Woolsey made the requirements of senior year far more rigorous than they had previously been. His tenure is also notable for his decision to invest more into the History and Political Science Departments, as well as his decision to expand Yale’s Graduate School. Woolsey served in the position for 25 years and passed away in 1889. (6-8)</p><p><br></p><p>Next to occupy the home was Woolsey’s son Theodore Salisbury, a Professor of International Law and a notable public intellectual. (9) He contracted architect Richard Clipston Sturgis to renovate the home in 1901 and the work was completed in 1906 (2). During this time the Church Street area remained an exclusive residential enclave, though the 1901 Atlas of New Haven and the 1911 and 1924 Sanborn maps shows that civic and commercial buildings were rapidly encroaching on the neighborhood (10-12). </p><p><br></p><p>It is difficult to trace the exact occupancy of the house, but from 1923 until 1930 the New Haven Directory lists the sole occupant as Edith Woolsey. According to a New York Times obituary, Edith Woolsey appears to have been the granddaughter of Theodore Salisbury Woolsey (13-16).</p><p><br></p><p>In 1935, Yale University purchased the home and converted the interior space into office space (3). The first commercial occupant was medical supply company E.L. Washburn and Co, and, according to the New Haven Directory entries for 1961, 1970, and 1990, two dentists, an optometrist, and a variety of other small businesses like a florist and a travel agency subsequently occupied the building. (17-20). The building is now home to Yale’s Student Mail and Shipping Center.</p><p><br></p><p>By the 1930s the residential area had been almost entirely converted into the commercial and civic hub that it is today. The 1923 Sanborn Map updated to 1951 shows that Timothy Dwight College and the Trinity Church Parish replaced some of the property’s neighbors. (21) </p><p><br></p><p>The renovation of the house into commercial space shows the ability of a building to adapt to its changing environment. Though the structure has never been demolished, it has gone through three distinct phases of life (simple home, elegant mansion, functional commercial building) as the needs of its occupants changed over time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>','<p>1.

Yale and its chosen architect aimed to build most up-to-date armory at minimum cost. As a result the armory was “to be severely plain in appearance and … emboy no real architectural character or style of any kind” (1). &nbsp;The main materials used for building were plaster, tile, concrete, wood and earth (1). The architect didn’t bother with architectural adornment (1). The one exception of the </span><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">castellated</strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> entry on the </span><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">facade</strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Yale Armory includes one central space and several rooms lining the sides of the “drill hall” (1). This main hall runs the length of the building and has access to natural light through the high-set metal sash windows designed in a style common to manufacturing and industrial buildings (1). The 1923 Sanborn maps highlight that armory’s main hall had an earth floor and tile walls (3). The Yale Daily News reported the earth floor comprised one-foot deep “shavings and sand,” ideal for cavalry-based military operation (1). </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Running the width of the building at the back of the armory, there is also a pistol range for the shooting practice (1). Three rooms attached to the drill hall feature the same tile walls, but have concrete floors instead of earthen ones (3). These rooms were originally dressing rooms, lecture halls and storage (3). One of the side storage rooms was separated from the rest of the structure by a sliding steel door. This door hid the armory’s arsenal, whose supplies came from the U.S. government. (1)</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The plan published in the </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Yale Daily News</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> (4) and subsequent references in the Yale Alumni Magazine (10) make clear that there is a stables attached to the armory. It’s difficult to tell where the stables are from looking at the Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps (3), but the plan of the architect (4) shows them clearly on the west end of the structure. While the armory was only one floor, the stables had a second floor with a small residential space for the stable keepers (1). </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">According the </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Yale Daily News</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">’ description of the planned armory stables, the structure could hold 120 horses, expanded from an original plan for 40 horses (1). The floors in the stables portion of the armory were made from wood block so as to avoid causing lameness in the horses, as concrete was known to do (4). The stables also featured an advanced ventilation system that allowed fresh air to go straight to the horses heads (4).</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The exterior of the armory also bears telltale signs of the utilitarian and low-cost focus of the architect. The roof follows a basic gable structure. Though the building’s exterior is just plaster covering tile (1), time has given it a dilapidated grayish-brown look. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The building’s </span><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">facade</strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> is, as mentioned above, the most architecturally intriguing aspect of the structure. The front has stepped, ziggurat-like wings that give the armory a dramatic presence on the street, even now in its vastly deteriorated state. The top of the stepped facade has </span><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">castellations</strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> evoking a much older, almost medieval military structure. The front of the building is essentially </span><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">symmetrical</strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">. As students and fans pour out of the Yale Bowl, just across the street, they might catch sight of the sharp edges and wonder what role the building might be. There is a certain </span><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">monumentalism</strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> to the armory on the side of the road in rural New Haven.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The front of the building has 10 centrally located windows, some broken, some cracked open, most filthy. The main entrance is an </span><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">arched double-doorway.</strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> The whole structure gives off an eerie feeling of abandonment. Along with the window and doors, there are several metal sheets that cover huge swathes of the front of the building. They have ribbing, almost like ventilation access points. It’s unclear what purpose these serve.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The sides of the building are much simpler than the front. They lack even the limited ornamentation of the facade. All plaster and concrete, the only breaks or respite from monotony are the occasional doors imprinted with words like “Staff Only” and the deteriorating windows. </span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The armory stands within New Haven city limits but just barely so. The 1923 Sanborn Maps clearly show the West Haven border just past the main structure (3). The setting is entirely rural, and was probably even more so when the armory was constructed. There are no residential or commercial structures in sight. The armory is set back from Central Avenue and accessible by two driveways. One that goes up to its main archway and another the goes around the south side to a parking lot. The parking lot also services the nearby fields. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Most interaction with the armory’s likely comes by way of athletes and spectators heading to events at the Yale Athletic Fields or the Bowl. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The New Haven Department’s documents register many changes and updates to the fields, such as the introduction of a softball field and field hockey field in 2001 (5), but seem to ignore the armory almost entirely.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Yale students bought the 30 acres that now house the armory and Yale Bowl after the university sold the Hamilton Park, where Yale students formerly held extracurricular games, in 1881 (6).</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Yale finished the armory in 1917 and has occupied it in some form or another ever since. In 1918, A. Conger Goodyear, Yale class of 1899, donated $14,000 &nbsp;— roughly $300,000 in 2017 valuation, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics — to finance the endeavor (7). Goodyear would go on to found the Museum of Modern Art (8), interesting in light of the fact that his earlier project — the armory —&nbsp;had so little to recommend itself artistically.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Yale Armory was, for all intents and purposes, not designed. The architect, Duane Lyman —&nbsp;a Yale Sheffield School graduate of 1903 — took up the project at no cost (1). Built in 1916 to house the Yale troops, guns and horses, the armory was intended as an instrument for the upcoming world war. There’s little evidence that it would have ever been constructed if not for the militarization in anticipation of the European fight.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Despite the extreme utilitarianism that governed the construction of the armory, it was —&nbsp;at the time — state of the art. In </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Yale: A History, </em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Brooks Mathers Kelley characterized it as “one of the finest armories in the country” (12). </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Yale’s newly founded ROTC, under the auspices of what was then called the United States Department of War, occupied the building from its beginnings during World War I until the army no longer saw use for a real military presence on Yale’s campus, after World War II (14). At the time of its introduction, it was the only college campus in America with an armory of its own — other than West Point, of course (13). </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Paul Kennedy, a Yale professor of military history, noted that the entire Yale campus mobilized for the First World War in a way that would be unfamiliar to current students: “By 1919 Yale was a sort of giant Gothic training camp, hardly a university at all.”(9)</span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Following the Second World War, the armory took on a new role, one much less serious than its original. Where before the stables served as home to cavalry steeds for a army regiments, now they would house ponies for the Yale Polo team. Where before the armory had protected an arsenal of soldiers’ arms, now it would stock the weapons of the recreational Rifle and Pistol Club. It even masqueraded under the name “Yale Polo and Equestrian Center.” (14)</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">It continued in this fashion until 2009, when the university determined that the Polo Club could no longer safely house its some 50 horses in the stables at the armory. The Polo Club had to quickly deaccession and find a new home for horses and practice. Though the stables were unusable, the team was able to use the drill hall as an exhibition space for the time being. Use of the armory has since been discontinued entirely for all extracurricular purposes. (10)</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">According to the Yale Athletics website, the Yale football team, neighbors across the street, also used the armory as locker rooms at one point in its early history. There’s no evidence of what time period this was (11). </span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">There’s no accessible evidence of what occupied the Yale Fields and the armory space prior to the current structures. The Sanborn Maps from before 1923 do not include the land on the far side of the West River. It seems that the land was an empty field from when Yale students purchased it in 1881 (6) until the university started the armory in 1916.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In February 1917, the </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Yale Daily News </em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">reported that fire burned down a storage shed and threatened the brand new armory. A boy scout troop came to help put out the fire when the groundskeeper discovered the flames. Though the source of the flames is unknown, it ultimately got little other coverage as the fire was completely contained. Only the storage shed was affected. (2)</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The 1923 Sanborn Map shows a veterans’ camp in the field adjacent to the armory. The camp was still active when the map was updated in 1938, but the university and ROTC operation running the site cut down on the available housing for vets. You can see the faint remains of the extra housing through the thinly pasted over paper (3). It’s also clear that there used to be a “burial” place where some current Yale fields are. There is an active cemetery nearby that may have replaced the burial site near the armory.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>','<ol><li><em>Yale Daily News</em>. 1916. “New Armory Ready by December, Says Col.

It is one of the many grand homes that was built on Whitney Avenue around the end of the 19<sup>th</sup>and beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup>century for wealthy families, and has remained a stable presence as the area has become slightly more commercial and more heavily populated by apartment complexes and multi-family homes.&nbsp;</p>','2.5 plus basement','50\' x 60\'','<p>Ingersoll family from 1896 until approximately 1910-11</p><p>William N.

On the right side is a “polygonal, flat-roofed” turret with a rectangular chimney extending above its center that exacerbates the asymmetry of the building.<a href="about:blank" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[ii]</a>The walls are orange-brown brick, their color not entirely homogenous, making them appealingly textured. The steeply&nbsp;<strong>hipped </strong>roof, which is composed of red slate tiles and has several high&nbsp;<strong>gables</strong>, is trimmed at its peak with a copper ridge as well as at its bottom with a copper&nbsp;<strong>cornice </strong>and&nbsp;<strong>bracketing</strong>.

To the north of the Ingersoll House is a funeral home, while apartments, houses, and multi-family complexes surround it on other sides. The styles used in this assortment of buildings vary widely from Queen Anne to Shingle Style to Tudor Revival, and in the vicinity there remain several other Chateauesque buildings from the late 19<sup>th</sup>century such as 375 Whitney, which now contains the headquarters of the Daughters of Isabella organization. Many of the buildings situated on this segment of Whitney Avenue are grand and distinguished residences that once belonged to the wealthiest businessmen of New Haven and are either single or multi-family homes today, so the Ingersoll House fits in quite well. Each home has shrubs, hedges, or trees that contribute to the widespread presence of greenery. Gables are a common stylistic theme to many of these buildings, as are dignified Doric columns to support front porch roofs, and there is generally a great variety of color in the buildings that brings playfulness and liveliness to the neighborhood.&nbsp;</p><p>	Whitney Avenue is a busy thoroughfare with wide streets and a steady flow of traffic, but in moments when the traffic ebbs there are brief moments of relative quiet accompanied by the calls and chirps of birds residing in mossy trees that arch over the sidewalks at regular intervals. These sidewalks are an integral part of the neighborhood and are constantly populated with people biking, walking, and jogging up and down both sides. While it is certainly a somewhat urban area with frequent bus stops and post office boxes on corners, the mainly residential side streets invite the casual passer-by into their quieter nooks. Cars on these streets are often parked quietly and add to a sense of removal from the city proper.</p>','<p>	Colin Macrae Ingersoll, Jr. (1858-1948), the head engineer of the New York, New Haven, and Hartford railroad, had this house designed and built for him by the Bridgeport architect Joseph W.

Ingersoll, Sr., who served in the US House of Representatives for two terms.<a href="about:blank" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[v]</a>Ingersoll Jr. was evidently respected and liked both in his professional and his personal life, with a newspaper at the time describing him both as “one of the most efficient and successful engineers in the country” and as “a genial, courteous gentleman”.<a href="about:blank" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[vi]</a>Ingersoll did not remain in this home for very long, however, leaving for New York City by 1912. At this point William N. Parker took residence in the building.<a href="about:blank" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[vii]</a></p><p>	When this home was built, Whitney Avenue was quickly becoming one of the more luxurious residential neighborhoods in New Haven.<a href="about:blank" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[viii]</a>The advent of the sewer and the horsecar allowed Whitney to be significantly more accessible to downtown than ever before, causing the area to explode with “great brick houses and baronial castles”.<a href="about:blank" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[ix]</a>The enormous Antebellum estates that had previously populated the area were divided into lots with large lawns that allowed wealthy individuals like Ingersoll to commission the construction of elaborate personalized homes, often in the Queen Anne style, such as the Richard Everit House at 641 Whitney.<a href="about:blank" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[x]</a>Much of Whitney thus became a “patrician showcase”.<a href="about:blank" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[xi]</a>During the late 19<sup>th</sup>and early 20<sup>th</sup>century cities were often perceived as crowded, dirty, and dangerous, and presumably Whitney Avenue provided a convenient and fashionable balance between access to the denser, thriving center of New Haven and removal from its perceived dinginess and disorder to create a neighborhood filled with privileged families who built homes to reflect their worldly sensibilities and large paychecks.</p><p>	In the early 20<sup>th</sup>century, Whitney’s desirability grew as it was considered to be one of the “healthiest and most advantageous” areas of the city thanks to the picturesque lawns and beautiful houses that came out of the early 1900s building boom.<a href="about:blank" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[xii]</a>Homes built during this time were often praised as being highly attractive, but no single style entirely prevailed.<a href="about:blank" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[xiii]</a>The Ingersoll House was occupied by several different families during the 20<sup>th</sup>century but was held for the longest by the Linahans, who owned it for almost 50 years.<a href="about:blank" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[xiv]</a>Approaching the 1950s, Whitney (especially north of Canner) became more of a middle class neighborhood as apartments and simpler, more affordable homes were built and businesses started to appear further and further north. As this process continued into the second half of the 1900s, a number of homes built around the turn of the century were demolished in order to make way for modern commercial buildings, more apartments, smaller homes, and additional community buildings like churches.<a href="about:blank" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[xv]</a>This was reflected in the commercializing of the Ingersoll House, which was acquired by the Pellegrino Law Firm in 1971 to be used as its offices.<a href="about:blank" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[xvi]</a></p><p>	Today, the Ingersoll House continues to act as the offices of the Pellegrino Law Firm and the neighborhood around it remains mostly residential with some assorted businesses. Not too far south, though, the opposite is true, with restaurants, businesses, and University buildings outnumbering residential buildings. The house is remarkably well kept, and a number of other houses constructed around the same time are looked after with equal care in recognition of both their historical and architectural significance and their aesthetic value. Others were unfortunately less looked after and have fallen into disrepair.<a href="about:blank" target="_blank" style="color: black;">[xvii]</a>Over time the Ingersoll House has acted as a historical marker: while the surrounding neighborhood has changed in many ways since 1896, becoming more accessible to middle class home buyers and more fully integrated into the urban fabric with sidewalks and bus lines, the eclectic mix of architecture and tree-lined roads have stayed the same. The area finds unity in its variety.</p><p><br></p><p><a href="about:blank" target="_blank">[i]</a>"Colin M.

Its twin style construction invokes the perfect symmetry of two separate row homes that appear to be stuck together, providing density while a well preserved and freshly painted wooded porch frames the entrances to four separate living units. The porch and roof trim are thematically linked by an eggshell blue paint which colors the low gabled roof and paired brackets that anchor the cornices (Image 2 and 4). Now sporting a handicapped accessible wheelchair lift and close proximity to the next-door rainbow park, the elegant 64 Edgewood has served generations of tenants in the Dwight neighborhood of New Haven since its construction in 1910 (2).&nbsp;</span></p>','2.5','<p>The Italianate detailing in this twin row home exemplifies the idiosyncratic aesthetics of architects in the late 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries (1). While its rectangular brick and wood construction appears relatively tame to the observer, its curved brick windows, lattice porch wood decorations, curved double corbel roof supports and double arched porch entrance invokes the Old World charm of English Italianate architecture. The porch serves as a decorative façade for the relatively plain brick building behind it, jutting out two feet beyond the house itself. The porches relatively intricate decorative works reflects the pastiche foreign architecture by architects like Henry Austin (1). Similar to the Willis Bristol House just around the corner at 584 Chapel Street, 64 Edgewood combines elements of Italianate detailing (itself a British caricature of “real” Italian architecture) and the Moorish supports in the wooden turned posts (Image 3), in its current flashy yet subtle burnt red accent color. </p><p>Even the symmetry of the double row house design seems to invoke an ideal of urban harmony. Everything in this house can be divided by two from the two perfectly symmetrical front facing attic windows, the four symmetrical chimneys jutting from the slightly hipped roof and even the double roof cornices that support a horizontal frieze that circumnavigates the building.&nbsp;</p>','<p>The building is located on a quiet tree lined stretch of Edgewood Ave. in between Howe and Dwight. To the right of the house from the sidewalk is Rainbow Park (Image 7). Down the driveway to its left sits what appears to be an abandoned oil change business at 62 Edgewood Ave (Image 6). While its construction in 1910 predates the Yale Residential College system by two decades (2), Yale has since expanded into the Dwight Neighborhood. The visual sight lines of Edgewood Avenue now culminate in the imposing presence of Pierson College just two blocks east (Image 8).&nbsp;</p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(68, 68, 68);">The lot that now contains the fourplex at 64 Edgewood was developed at the height of the American street car city. In fact, the 1888 Atlas of New Haven reveals that horse stables once existed in the very place where apartment now stands (3). The road was known as Martin Street at that time, as Edgewood Avenue would only be named such once the plans for Edgewood Park by Fredrick Law Olmstead came about in 1910 (4). 1910 also marks the year the building was constructed, although some have placed the date earlier in year c. 1895 (5). A street car line trundles down Edgewood in the 1911 Atlas of New Haven, perhaps designed as an infrastructural auxiliary to the park, perhaps constructed by coincidence (6). In any case, by the time the extant building makes an appearance in the 1911 Atlas, elements of Beaux Arts urban planning had been implemented. This is shown in the grassy median between streetcar lines further down Edgewood Avenue (6). By the time of the 1911 Atlas, the horse stables had been demolished and the housing density of the neighborhood began to increase dramatically (6). </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(68, 68, 68);">In 1911, the building was owned and operated by Charles M. Fabrique, a graduate of Yale College in 1842 (7) and an active member of the New Haven Free Mason Societies(8). While there is no proof that the Fabrique family owned the lot prior to 1911 or facilitated the building’s construction, evidence would point to such a conclusion as the building was constructed in 1910 and is known to be owned by Charles Fabrique in the 1911 Atlas of New Haven (6). &nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(68, 68, 68);">It is not certain why the Fabrique family would be interested in a large real estate investment in the Dwight neighborhood, especially considering a 1906 obituary for Charles’s wife Caroline Fabrique confirms that the family lived in a private home located at 20 Stanley street, but it is easy to speculate(9). It was most likely an attempt to capitalize on the booming desirability of the Dwight Neighborhood in response to the construction of Edgewood park and the corresponding street car lines. These urban developments, like those all across American in the early 20</span><sup style="color: rgb(68, 68, 68);">th</sup><span style="color: rgb(68, 68, 68);"> Century transformed streets like this section of Edgewood and all of Whalley Ave into the commercial corridors we have today. As outlined by Yale School of Architecture Professor Elihu Rubin, urban infrastructure development of parks and transit lines and real estate speculation are inextricably linked(1). In fact, the lightning quick development of the lot in the </span><em style="color: rgb(68, 68, 68);">same year</em><span style="color: rgb(68, 68, 68);"> that plans for Edgewood Park were revealed beg the question as to how much stake the Fabrique family had in Olmstead’s design. Did they, like those in New York’s Uptown neighborhoods, advocate for the construction of the park and street car lines to increase the value of their investments? Answering questions like these can be difficult, but can give us insight into the powers that determine and shape our cities for years to come. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(68, 68, 68);">The history of 64 Edgewood gets rather murky moving on from the Fabrique family. Without Atlases that denote the owners of the buildings, maps like those of the Sanborn Insurance Company tells us relatively little except that the building has not been demolished or altered significantly. In the mid-20</span><sup style="color: rgb(68, 68, 68);">th</sup><span style="color: rgb(68, 68, 68);"> Century, the Dwight Neighborhood experienced a wave of African American transplants from the south and with it, a wave of white flight from the neighborhood (10). With current trends now shifting white people back into urban cores and with the increased presence of Yale development and student tenants, the neighborhood appears to be on the cusp of another demographic shift (11).&nbsp;</span></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(68, 68, 68);">An 1851 Wall Map of New Haven shows that the site was undeveloped at that time (12). By the time we reach the 1888 Atlas, the lot contains horse stables and two small structures of wood and brick owned by I. W. Hine (3). The 1911 Atlas shows the extant building owned by Charles M. Fabrique (6). Since then, it is unclear who has owned the building as maps like those made by the Sanborn Insurance Company do not include the names of owners and thus the property rights become hard to pin down. Today, the building ownership is still murky, although the exterior does not sport the logo of a large real estate company like Pike International.&nbsp;</span></p>','<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rubin, Elihu.

The facade is achieved by the building’s cornice, fine brickwork, and ornamented windows. An extension was added in 1910 out the rear of the building to facilitate the library\'s growing needs and usage. Both the original building and the extension have suffered mild water damage due to an aged, inadequate roof, but the exterior of the building remains in good condition. The library services New Haven through both its circulation department and the variety of community events it hosts.</p>','23’x190’','3 1/2','<p>The Institute Library’s Queen Anne style is emphasized by ornamental brickwork, stone arches outlining the windows, a wood cornice, and steps leading up to a sunken entryway. Tuscan columns divide pairs of windows on the third story of the building, with floral decor placed over each window on the third story and the attic. In both the 1878 original building and the 1910 extension, there is substantial water damage to the interior walls, causing cracking, bubbling behind the plaster, and peeling paint. These issues also apply to the ceiling; the cause of which is an aged roof in need of replacement. In addition, the attic has a number of missing or broken floorboards. The exterior of the building is in better condition than the interior; the brick and cornice are both in good shape, and look as though they have been recently painted and are kept clean. However, there is one window on the attic level which is smashed and covered, and a second window which has a hole approximately a foot in diameter.</p>','<p>847 Chapel Street is located in downtown New Haven, on the block adjacent to the southwest corner of the New Haven Green. It is part of a row of historic buildings, most of which are similarly three stories with an attic space, and share a similar Queen Anne style. Parking is not available in front of the building, but there is a public parking lot across the road.</p>','<p>Founded in 1826, the Institute Library’s humble beginnings were formed by a group of young men in New Haven who met to discuss, debate, and collect literary sources (3). As their activities caught the attention of the public, increased financial support and membership led to the official founding of the New Haven Young Men’s Institute in 1841, and the site for the Institute Library was constructed in 1878 (1, 2, 3). As physical libraries have suffered due to the rise of electronic information, the Institute Library has successfully rebranded itself as a venue for social gatherings, hosting a variety of events from book launches to private parties to an LGBTQ+ youth group, as well as being the gathering place for the New Haven Review. The library still maintains a large circulation of fiction and non-fiction material, hosts a complete collection of the New Haven Directory back to 1854, and is Connecticut’s oldest remaining membership library (3).</p>','<p>The site was previously unoccupied, and was developed in 1878 along with neighbouring buildings on the street sharing similar architectural qualities (1, 5). As the library grew and sought to expand, the Institute built an extension out the back of the building in 1910; a change which can be seen between the 1886 and 1924 New Haven Sanborn Maps (5, 6). Since this addition, the site has remained unchanged, although future plans to make the building wheelchair accessible could alter the site depending on where the elevator is installed. </p>','<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Haven Historic Resources Inventory, Phase III, Volume I: Essays and Methodology, 104.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Haven Historic Resources Inventory, Phase III, Volume I: Essays and Methodology, Continuation Sheet, 104</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Institute Library, “History”. <a href="https://institutelibrary.org/history/" target="_blank">https://institutelibrary.org/history/</a> [Retrieved Feb. 25, 2018.]</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Institute Library, “Building”. <a href="https://institutelibrary.org/mission-statement/building-campaign/" target="_blank">https://institutelibrary.org/mission-statement/building-campaign/</a> [Retrieved Feb. 25, 2018.]</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sanborn Map Company of New York, Insurance Maps of New Haven Connecticut, Volume 1, 1886, 4.</p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sanborn Map Company of New York, Insurance Maps of New Haven Connecticut, Volume 1, 1924, 7.&nbsp;</p>');

Its symmetry, brick layout and central windows suggest a federal style. However, there are several smaller accessories that suggest an Italianate style. Much like the restaurants it holds, the building’s architecture is not limited to one particular style or region. Each of the three restaurant’s façades aim to entice diners and allude to their cultural heritages. Pitaziki’s glass windows draw customers into the brightly light dining area that sits in front of their chipotle-esque counter that houses a number of Mediterranean food options options. Prime 16’s dark windows and weathered wood exude the old fashion and Americana vibes that preempt the craft beers and burgers inside. Lalibela’s maroon pilasters prepare patrons for the homelike feel that is evoked inside the Ethiopian eatery. A belt course made of concrete juts out from the building demarcating the second story. This clear separation begins emphasizes the difference between the buildings 1st and 2nd floors. The second floor is adorned with many of the Italianate flourishes. In the center of the second floor are several green Tuscan pilasters. Above the larger lower pilasters, sit smaller pilasters adorned with flowers. On either side of the pilasters sits a larger window with a transom window above it. The half round transom window is decorated with birds facing away from the center. Between the pilasters are indented brick squares, which allude to the transom windows on the end. During the summer the leaves of the trees obscure the views of the second floor, further removing it from the bustling sidewalk and restaurants below. The front of the building was updated more recently than the back of the building, which is clear from the divide on the side of the building. The update ensures that the building presents its best side to passers-by.&nbsp;</p>','<p>The building sits in a bustling section of downtown New Haven. Its block contains a luxury hotel, a new nightclub and several other restaurants. Just a block from the New Haven green and several bus stops, it is rare to find a quiet moment out front of the building. Alongside the building is a pocket park. This pocket park provides an oasis of quiet amongst the bustle of downtown New Haven. The restaurants serve patrons from late morning through the early morning hours to please students, families, and late night club goers.&nbsp;</p>','<p>The building was built sometime between 1911 and 1914 as a commercial space and has remained one to this day. No tenant is historically significant on its own, but as a group and time series, the tenants represent the changing demographics and technology of New Haven, and more broadly the US, throughout the 20<sup>th</sup> century. It housed four stores at its beginning, a livery, a saloon, a clothier and a tailor. The livery was replaced by an office equipment store by 1927 showing the move towards the white-collar businesses that grew in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. The druggist’s replacement of the saloon was emblematic of the growing medical knowledge at the same time. Lauber’s sporting goods store highlights the fact that New Haven was the birthplace of American football and was once home to the best college and professional teams in the nation. These evolutions continue in the 1950s with auto parking and the 1960s brought about a savings and loan association. By 1980 the building housed a cosmetic store, a leather and luggage shop, a merchandise store and an optician. More recently it has evolved to become a restaurant space. These restaurants show the melting pot of cultures present in New Haven as the classic “American food” restaurant is saddled between Ethiopian and Mediterranean cuisine.</p>','<p>Prior to the construction of the current structure, there existed a chapel for the Trinity Church Parish, an episcopal congregation with a church a block away on the New Haven green. Additionally there was a YMCA next door prior to its construction. These sites clearly made the location a place for community engagement and congregation. While the building now may not play as formal a role in the social lives of New Haven residents, the quiet pocket park alongside may allude to the sentiment of openness and assembly that once stood on its grounds.&nbsp;</p>','<p><em>Atlas of New Haven Connecticut</em>.

A subway sign demands to be seen with its bright green and yellow logo. Other shops are visible, attempting to draw attention in different ways. SeeClickFix, the successful non-profit sits on the second floor looking down from above. The top two floors and the accompanying brick look like they are taken from a past age. Vacant with slight indications of decay, the top two floors remind the viewer of the reality of business in New Haven. Although this building was once a commercial hub, it now sits at the corner of a commercial district that doesn’t draw nearly as many patrons as it once did. If you walk up towards the Green and glance back at the green the molding on the second floor extends out into the blue sky gesturing to a history that has disappeared.

Dunkin\' Donuts and a recently opened Dollar General also share the block. Across the street stands the bold, heavily-ornamented, domineering luxury grocery store and apartments of Elm City Market. Another glance upward and the towering 360 State Street looms. 742 Chapel Street is out of another era. Although it has seen many different businesses and even non-profits, the building essentially holds the same commercial role it once held. The significant change has happened around it. In the early 1900s the building was surrounded by small banks and State Street held commercial and residential properties. This would change with the expansion of the railroad and economic decline of the mid 20th century. Although there are buildings around, the main source of traffic is State Street itself and the bus stop that sits in front of the nail salon.&nbsp;</p>','<p>&nbsp;From Deacon Charles Bostwick 1845 drawing, shortly after construction in 1832,&nbsp;we can see that this particular site started as “Titus Street’s House and Store.” The building was later owned by the Hill family or was part of the Hill Estate. The social history of the building is tied to the commercial and historical Ninth Square of New Haven. The building seems to fit neatly into the huge growth of commercial enterprise as the first industrial revolution boomed before the Civil War. Following the Civil War the building underwent a makeover, changing hands but maintaining its commercial value. The area close to the building at that time was bustling. Banks and other shops littered the corners and adjacent blocks. We see, however, as manufacturing began to fail, and the city took an economic turn for the worse the buildings surrounding 742 Chapel Street began to be demolished. The different color brick at the back of the building is perhaps the starkest evidence of this change. As the city tries to reform its identity in this contemporary moment, balancing local business with national chains, non-profit with profit, 742 Chapel stands as a sort of metaphor for that uncertainty in development. The building at the corner is on the precipice of development, and its purchase by a large New York firm is further evidence of that potential or perhaps danger of redevelopment.&nbsp;</p>');

As one of the major hotels in downtown New Haven, the hotel has accommodated hundreds of thousands of visitors from all over the world. A century ago, the address was occupied a Catholic Church. Two decades ago, it was a medical hotel.

The classic brick material allows the hotel to resonate with the rest of the neighborhood, while the stone columns maintain the refinement of the hotel’s facade. The hotel is composed of seven stories: the first floor is the lobby and the second to seven floors are guestrooms. The second floor has a restaurant, and several floors have a meeting room. The hotel underwent a series of renovations throughout its 29-year history, one of the recent ones being in 2014 when it added guest rooms and a meeting room on the third floor [2].</p><p>Geometric and stylish, the exterior of the New Haven Hotel keeps ornaments minimal. The building is a cube with windows that are roughly symmetric and equal in number across the front, side, and back facades. A lack of protrusions, with the exception of the minimal coping, adds to the simple modernistic nature of the building. Fenestration pattern is constant and regular except for the highest floor, in which the window is circular and comes with a cross-shaped mullion. </p><p>Recently renovated, the refined lobby represents its nobility with low-saturated and high-contrast colors. The royal pigmentation provides a luxurious but comforting feeling for visitors. The guest rooms are standard and clean, and some rooms come with magnificent view that overlooks the neighborhood and part of Yale’s campus. </p><p>One characteristic that distinguishes the New Haven Hotel from its counterparts is an abundance of pictures on the walls of the lobby and guest rooms showing Yale architecture and landscape.</p>','<p>Located within the hub of the city of New Haven, the New Haven Hotel provides refuge for guests to take a rest from the downtown hustle. </p><p>The neighborhood is full of activity: small retail stores, bars, and restaurants of various ranks surround the hotel. Right to the east is the Bow Tie Criterion Cinema. A short walk up College Street brings one to the Shubert Theatre. Proximity to drug stores and convenience stores assure convenience to the guests. The hotel is also highly rated for its easy access to public transportation including the bus stop and Union Station.&nbsp;</p>','<p>The New Haven Hotel was built in 1989 as a “medical hotel” called the New Haven Medical Hotel on a budget of $7.8 million [3]. The rise in demand for this type of hotel in New Haven is tied to the rapid growth of the Yale-New Haven Hospital complex in the late 1980s [4]. Medical hotels are designed to give qualified patients a more independent recuperating environment while being close to the medical center. Qualified patients are patients who no longer have acute care needs but are not yet eligible to be discharged to home. They are also restricted to “ambulatory” patients who are capable of walking by themselves (with a wheelchair or assistance, if necessary) and not bed-dependent. The rooms of the medical hotel resembled regular hotel rooms, with two beds, carpeting, and television. A relative or friend stayed with the patient to care for the patient in place of the physician, and the environment provided more independence to the patients than a regular hospitalization setting did. </p><p>The hotel was owned and operated by the Temple Medical Center, a comprehensive outpatient medical center located across George street from the hotel [5].&nbsp;Although the hotel is no longer owned by the Temple Medical Center, their connection is evident in the pedestrian bridge that connects the second floors of the two facilities [6]. Another reminiscence of the medical hotel in the New Haven Hotel is the wide elevator that was built to be able to carry on a stretcher [7].</p><p>By 2004, the New Haven Medical Hotel changed its name to the New Haven Hotel and its function to accommodate non-hospital guests. It is currently a normal hotel with more than 120 guest rooms of various types [8] and average price of $159 per night [9]. As a non-medical hotel, the New Haven Hotel experienced a shift in social function from accommodating patients to accommodating visitors from all over the world, playing an important role in New Haven’s revitalization from economic stagnancy. In striving for urban renewal, New Haven has directed its efforts towards bringing people into the city to work, to shop, and to enjoy themselves [10]. &nbsp;In particular, the downtown area has experienced an influx of business and recreational activities in the 2000s. Amid these endeavors, hotels served an integral social function of attracting and providing space for visitors to New Haven. </p><p>Currently, the New Haven Hotel is owned by 229 George St. LLC, whose headquarters are located in Providence. [11]</p>','<p>By the late-18<sup>th</sup> century, the land was owned by the Gilbert Family who had a leather store on 105 George Street.&nbsp;A different family of the same name had occupied the land as residential space. [12]</p><p>In 1868, the Boniface Roman Catholic Church was built on 229 George Street [13]. By 1930, however, the church was moved to 636 State Street, and the one on 229 George Street was used as a repair garage until it was razed in 1936. There were three realty sales, and the largest warranty deed was from Barbara Fresenius to Esther Schwartz at the cost of $1500. [14]</p><p>&nbsp;The space remained vacant until 1989 when the current New Haven Hotel was built. </p><p><br></p><p>Established next to 229 George Street sometime in the 20<sup>th</sup> century is the United Illuminating Co. [15] The fact that 229 George Street and its adjacent buildings had been a church, a hotel (normal and medical), and an electric company suggests that the area has been a long history as a hub of public service. </p><p>The function of 229 George Street as a place of public convention is inherited to the hospitable lobby of the current New Haven Hotel. As its name implies, the New Haven Hotel is the intersection of the flow of people that come in and out of New Haven from the local I-95 highway. 229 George Street will continue to be a symbol of development and community bonding as New Haven attracts new visitors.&nbsp;</p>','<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vision Government Solutions. http://gis.vgsi.com/newhavenct/Search.aspx.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificate of Occupation, Office of Building Inspection and Enforcements, New Haven Hall of Records.</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificate of Approval, Office of Building Department, New Haven Hall of Records.</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;City of New Haven Redevelopment Agency, City Plan Department.</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificate of Occupation, Office of Building Inspection and Enforcements, New Haven Hall of Records.</p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Haven City Plan Commission Design Review, Buildings Department, New Haven Hall of Records.</p><p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificate of Substantial Completion, Building Department, New Haven Hall of Records.</p><p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guest Room Count, Building Department, New Haven Hall of Records.</p><p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"New Haven Hotel."

According to a historic resources inventory report by the State of Connecticut, the building consists of four square units linked around a cross-shaped axis, although this structure is hard to discern from the outside.

The Yale School of Nursing began looking for a suitable location in 1993 and found it at 100 Church Street South in 1994 and the move-in was complete from 1995 to 1996.

At one time or another, a number of treasured local businesses, such as the famed Mike’s Meat Market (1930-1978) and later Tony and Lucille’s, were located at 127 Wooster Street. (1) A three-story, rectangular building with a low-pitched, nearly flat roof, and overhanging eaves ornamented with fairly unassuming brackets, the building graces the corner of Chestnut and Wooster streets. Owned by the Society of Santa Maria Maddalena since 1905, this building, which houses 121, 123, 125 and 127 Wooster, has historically featured a mixture of commercial and residential uses. (2) 127 Wooster Street, a one-story commercial front carved out of the first floor of 125 Wooster sometime in the 20<sup>th</sup> century, has been occupied by Americana Memories since 2016, a store specializing in vintage college pennants. 121 to 125 Wooster are all residential, with 123 Wooster housing the Society of Santa Maria Maddalena, the Italian fraternal organization which owns the building as a whole.&nbsp;</p>','10,714 Square Footage (55\' x 37\') ','3','<p>Please refer to document titled "Past Tenants" in the multimedia gallery for this entry.</p>','<p>Situated on the northern edge of the historic Wooster Square District, in an area “featuring a mixture of residential and commercial architecture dating from the mid-nineteenth through mid-twentieth century,” this building likewise serves a number of residential, commercial and social functions. (4) Prominently standing on the corner of Wooster and Chestnut streets, with a bit of distance from the smaller residential buildings which surround it, this imposing brick row house is a familiar feature of this quiet, yet cheerful New Haven neighborhood. Walking west along Wooster Street, one encounters Frank Pepe’s Pizzeria, Libby’s Italian Pastry Shop, Tony &amp; Lucille’s and Sally’s Apizza, all famous family-run Italian institutions which lend Wooster Street its claim to fame. No longer as prosperous as it once was, however, Wooster does show some signs of an economic downturn. Nevertheless, this peaceful street, dotted with a restaurants, residences and commercial stores, exudes the charm of a tranquil residential environment in which friends and family can continue to enjoy the legacies of New Haven’s famous Italian immigrants.&nbsp;</p>','<p>Erected with red brick, a common material for Italianate style constructions of the time, this row building represents a “typical and relatively intact example of the type of multi-residential structures erected in the Wooster Square area during the Civil War/Reconstruction era.” (3) A boxy building with three levels and four entries, its low hip roof bears such a slight slant, that it appears completely flat at first glance. Its heavy wooden cornice, decorated with relatively simple brackets placed at regular intervals, marks the roof’s defining feature. The windows, in contrast to other Italiante style buildings of the time, do not feature any pedimentation or intricate ornamentation. Only the subtle lintels above and the sills below give the white windows added character. On the building’s right hand side, two protruding white porticos with square columns cover the raised porches atop the two staircases at 121 and 123 Wooster. On the left side, at the corner of Wooster and Chestnut, a rather odd four-sided protrusion juts out into the street to form the angled commercial entrance of 127 Wooster. Most likely added sometime between 1925 and 1975 when it replaced the original raised porch at 125 Wooster, this commercial facade, whose corner is cut off so as to have the door be angled to the sidewalk, is notably a different material, style and color than the rest of the building. The building, built in c. 1870, is beginning to show some signs of old age.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>','<p>In many ways, 121-127 Wooster Street has played a central role in the development of what is now recognized, with some degree of nostalgia, as the Little Naples of New Haven. It seems clear to locals and outside observers alike that the heyday of this neighborhood has passed. To that end, Wooster Street has remained as a kind of living relic to the Italian immigrant community which once flourished here beginning in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, when scores of Italians came to the United States seeking better economic opportunities. (5) It is not surprising then that the tenants, such as the Espositos, the Ferraras, the DeVitos, who resided at 121-127 Wooster Street seem to be of largely Italian origin. As far as one can tell, it appears that since its construction in c. 1870, the apartments at 121-123-125 Wooster have always been residential units, housing a large number of tenants, perhaps with one individual or family on each of the three floors. Since 1905, 123 Wooster Street, in particular, has housed the Society of Santa Maria Maddalena, the oldest Italian-American fraternal organization in Connecticut. Founded on May 1, 1898, this Society, named for the patron saint of Atrani, Italy, provided aid to newly-arrived Italian immigrants, assisting them with “housing, employment and legal matters.” (6) Today, the Society, which has struggled to maintain its appeal with the younger generations, has shifted towards more community-oriented activities. (7) The Society of Santa Maria Maddalena, whose feast day is celebrated every July in New Haven, has played such a prominent role in the city’s history that in 1998, the corner of Wooster and Chestnut streets was named in its honor. (8) In contrast to 121-125 Wooster, 127 Wooster seems to have always served a&nbsp;commercial purpose. In fact, over the span of many decades, it has been home to a number of famous Italian businesses that have played key roles in the lives of New Haven’s large Italian community. In particular, from 1938 to 1970, 127 Wooster housed the famous family-run butcher, Mike’s Meat Market. In the ensuing decades, it would welcome both Tony and Lucille’s, which is now situated down the block at 150 Wooster Street, and Anastasio’s Ristorante.&nbsp;</p>','<p>From what this researcher could gather, it appears that there was no urban structure situated in this location before the construction of 121-127 Wooster Street in c. 1870. The Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps show its continuous occupation since the late 19<sup>th</sup> century. The construction of this building hints at the expansion of the Wooster Square neighborhood from one that was heavily centered around the commercial activity of the seaport, to a flourishing residential and commercial district in its own right.</p>','<p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;New Haven City Directories, 1914-2006. </p><p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;“118 Times, &amp; Counting,” <em>New Haven Independent</em>, July 25, 2016, http://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/santa_maria_maddelana/.</p><p>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;“Item 1950,” New Haven Historic Resources Inventory, Phase II, Volume VIII, Items 1847-1974, <em>New Haven Preservation Trust.</em></p><p>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;Ibid.</p><p>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;“Wooster Square Historic District,” National Register of Historic Places Inventory, July 1969.

Its long brick austere walls create a sense of density that is interrupted by the levity of the glass and steel portico facing the parking lot. The pedestrian along Whalley Avenue should notice the enclosed porch which served as the original entrance and ticket booth of the structure back when New Haven residents would arrive to see a movie or rock concert.

After steering their way through the narrow parking lot, they face the blank sturdy walls that support the structure. The austerity of the modernist façade however is broken by a slight decorative element: the outdoor light fixtures hanging at the level of the first-floor ceilings curve in the <strong>Art Noveau</strong> whiplash fashion. Relative to the size of the structure, these lights are slender. There is also a green ribbon that runs parallel to ground before a kink shifts it upward. Both the lights and ribbon complement the atrium whose magnitude and decorative elements present a departure from the rest of the structure. It resembles a glass <strong>portico</strong> topped with a hollow triangular <strong>pediment</strong>, with steel beams in place of columns. The glass windows on the first floor continue this <strong>neoclassical</strong> motif, their steel borders representing columns. The focal point of the exterior is marked by the circle of steel at the top of the portico. The portico and light fixtures were added after the conversion of the structure into Edge of the Woods. </p><p><br></p><p>The Whalley Avenue façade presents an exemplary model of adaptive reuse. Where there once stood a lobby and ticket booths to a movie theater, there is now floor to ceiling windows that allow light to filter into the café section of the complex. The <strong>frieze</strong> that once announced what movies were showing below the movie theater’s marquee now announces ‘Natural Foods.’ While this side of the exterior was once the principal façade of the structure, it now plays a secondary role. </p><p><br></p><p>The back of the building is not particularly relevant except in the sense that the commercial/industrial nature of its function contrasts sharply with the <strong>Greek Revival</strong> architecture of Norton Street. In fact, the zbuilding has a kink in order to accommodate a residential building that interrupts the linear border of the lot on which Edge of the Woods sits. </p><p><br></p><p>The interior is also an interesting example of adaptive reuse. In its iteration as a movie theater, the floor was slanted so as to provide an unobstructed view of the stage/screen for seats. But when the building was repurposed as a nightclub, the floor was leveled. The balcony which once held seating for patrons or standing room for revelers, now holds additional café space and a section for health books. The ticket booths now hold kitchens for the deli and café on the first floor. The observant visitor may notice <strong>Ionic columns</strong> in the corners of the interior on the second floor, reflecting the decorative tastes of the 1920s movie theater. The stage is now covered by drywall, separating the food section from the area intended for unloading, storage, and separation. Most impressively, the current owner has built an entire wooden balcony on the second floor that extends from the original balcony to the northern side of the building. </p><p><br></p><p>The décor of the building reflects the horticultural centricity of Edge of the Woods. The <strong>arches</strong> supporting the balcony, are painted as trunks with branches expanding upward. The balcony is painted as the canopy. &nbsp;The produce section exists under the skeleton of a hoop house. Nonetheless, the structure alludes to its past with neon signage from Paramount, a New Haven movie theater that closed in the early 1970s. The bright green sign accentuates this vegetative motif, harmonizing past and present use.&nbsp;</p>','<p>Edge of the Woods sits on Whalley Avenue, a major thoroughfare in the City of New Haven that is lined with many commercial properties. In fact, Edge of the Woods is only a half-mile from a corporate supermarket, Stop &amp; Shop. On the block-scale, it shares a parking lot with smaller commercial operations across from it. This strip mall and the supermarket are managed by the same property owner. Although Edge of the Woods fits neatly into the Whalley Avenue streetscape, if approached from the North, the structure signals an abrupt border to the quiet residential neighborhood of Beaver Hills. The back of the building and the austerity of the unpainted brick contrasts sharply with the color and detail of the Greek Revival homes along Norton Street.&nbsp;</p>','<p>The Sanborn maps and the New Haven Atlas of 1911 reveal that the site was first developed at the turn of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century as large residential properties. By the 1920s, when Whalley had become increasingly commercial and the property had been sold, the existing structure was demolished, and a small movie house was constructed. The movie house would serve the local neighborhood population for the first twenty years of its existence until a renovation in the 1940s expanded its capacity to seat 945 people. At this point, the movie theater began to receive reels from larger production companies and became increasingly competitive within Maurice Bailey’s portfolio of New Haven movie theaters. Bailey’s theaters closed with his death in 1978.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>With the entrance of Rock &amp; Roll into mainstream culture, there was a demand for music venues throughout the country and New Haven. On York Street, Toad’s Place opened its doors in 1975. Agora Ballroom was established at 379 Whalley Avenue in 1983. However, the site would change names annually until 1985, when it would cease its operations as a short-lived music venue. </p><p><br></p><p>Meanwhile, a group of yogis had created a vegetarian supermarket on Edgewood Avenue in order to promote their vegetarian lifestyle to the broader public. Looking to expand, they saw an opportunity at the site on Whalley Avenue. Accordingly, they moved into the site in 1986 and have operated their supermarket ever since. It is important to note that Claire’s Corner Copia, the famous vegetarian restaurant, had opened its doors in 1975. Perhaps the emergence of Edge of the Woods suggests a larger sociocultural trend that prioritizes healthy food. If so, the commercial history of 379 Whalley Avenue reflects greater trends in American culture –– in music and in food.&nbsp;</p>','<p>Residential structures existed on the site before they were demolished in favor of a movie theater on the area in the 1920s. The theater would then be converted into nightclub in the 1980s. Finally, the structure would be converted into a supermarket in the late 1980s.</p><p><br></p><p>The site would also experience growth other than the supermarket structure. In 1900, a structure was built towards the back of a lot which would serve as a pillow factory. It would eventually become vacant, but Edge of the Woods, seeing an expansion opportunity, bought the structure in 2012. The bottom floor now serves as a warehouse; the top floor contains two apartments. The property owner and manager of Edge of the Woods is also responsible this structure. </p><p><br></p><p>Across the parking lot is a strip mall containing a dry cleaner, tax accountants, and fast food restaurants that was built in 1968. The shared parking lot became a source of contention between the property owner of Edge of the Woods and the owner of the strip mall. When the property was put up for sale, Edge of the Woods proceeded to purchase it. In this manner, Edge of the Woods is not only a supermarket but also a property manager, operating under the corporate name, Dodge Realty LLC.&nbsp;</p>','<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: black;">"Agora Ballroom (NH)." </span><em style="color: black;">Rock Tour</em><span style="color: black;">. http://rocktourdatabase.com/venues/agora-ballroom-nh.a</span></p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: black;">ArcGis Maps.

The collection of residential, commercial, and institutional buildings—each executed in a different architectural style—creates a “…rather ragged lineup,” as the individual buildings are interesting yet together incoherent.<a href="#_ftn3" target="_blank">[3]</a></p><p><br></p><p><a href="#_ftnref1" target="_blank">[1]</a> Amy L.

Allen house at 357 Whitney Avenue is a heightened example of the Queen Anne Style. Standing two and a half stories tall, the structure of the house itself is a compilation of various colors, angles, and geometric shapes. As noted by the New Haven Historic Resources Inventory, the varying wall surfaces, window shapes, colors and textures of the brick masonry, and the multiple rooflines create a rather jarring and asymmetrical form.<a href="#_ftn1" target="_blank">[1]</a> </p><p>	&nbsp;Looking from the front, the building’s most prominent feature is the large cylindrical bay on its right side. Crowned with a conical slate and asphalt shingle roof, this element creates three rotunda-like spaces on each of the floors. Each rotunda is characterized by a series of large windows, with three windows neatly aligned on each of the bottom two floors and four on the top half-floor. The remainder of the house seems to grow out of this cylindrical bay, and, though generally box-like in form, sports its own unique adornments. For example, the top left roof of the house boasts a small octagonal cupola, one that echoes the conical tower directly beside it. Likewise, the second floor of the house has a triple-paned bay window on the left side, as well as a smaller, quainter window directly above the entrance. The entrance of the house fuses Neoclassical elements with the Queen Anne style. The front porch “ has a flat roof with brackets under the eves,” as well as a wide wooden panel, decorated with swag relief, that is held between fluted ionic columns.<a href="#_ftn2" target="_blank">[2]</a> The front doors are wooden with double panes of glass, and a substantial, arched window is located directly to their left. </p><p>	The right side of the building, facing Lawrence Street, exemplifies the structure’s variant, haphazard style. Executed with alternating tan and red brick, the separate, boxy bays appear to be stacked one on top of the other. With multiple windows on the south side, the most notable include the bay window on the left of the second floor and the oval detail on the right. Along with two chimneys gracing both the top and far right of the house, two diamond-like brick medallions add a distinctive ornamental touch. </p><p>	The back of the building is rather blunt and plain in nature. Largely rectangular, it is characterized by two small square windows on the basement level, four simple windows on the first floor, and two on the second floor. On the far right a small porch juts out of the back entrance, supported by two tiny Doric columns. Lastly, a petite, square cupola adorns the back roof. Perhaps to the viewer’s surprise, Allen combines all of these elements into a bold cohesion. Today, while easily lost among the continuous traffic and general architectural incoherence of Whitney Avenue, the structure stands as a delightful reminder of New Haven’s early history and outward expansion.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><a href="#_ftnref1" target="_blank">[1]</a> Amy L. Hudnall, “Historic Resources Inventory.”</p><p><a href="#_ftnref2" target="_blank">[2]</a> Amy L. Hudnall, “Historic Resources Inventory.”</p>','<p>	Without a doubt, the fate of 357 Whitney has been determined by the gradual development of its urban setting. Upon its initial construction in 1897, the structure stood with the two adjacent Queen Anne mansions as the lone residential buildings on lower Whitney. By 1910, however, the greater Whitney area began to grow steadily with an increasing number of urban housing developments and commercial offices. With the coming of the horsecar and the gradual adoption of the automobile, traffic intensified and Whitney emerged as one of the main, bustling avenues by which residents accessed downtown New Haven.<a href="#_ftn1" target="_blank">[1]</a> Thus, what was once a beautiful, quiet residential environment transformed quickly into an active commercial hub.</p><p>	As the pace of Whitney Avenue quickened, the architectural cohesion of the street began to deteriorate. Elizabeth Mills Brown attributes this deterioration to the commercial rush following World War I: “As usual, the shift was inconspicuous at first, prestige institutional buildings moving discreetly in among the mansions. Before long they were followed by commercial uses and drab apartments”.<a href="#_ftn2" target="_blank">[2]</a> Brown further notes that twelve of Whitney’s most impressive houses are gone, leaving a “ragged lineup” of singularly interesting buildings on an avenue that has “lost coherence”. <a href="#_ftn3" target="_blank">[3]</a> </p><p>	Today, the urban environment of 357 Whitney remains a patchwork of architectural styles and structural functions. Directly across the street from the site stands a collection of colonial revival buildings, each of which contributes to an air of stylistic competition when compared with the sequence of Queen Anne mansions of which 357 Whitney is a part (Image 6). The farther one travels down Lawrence Street, however, the more peaceful the environment becomes, as walkers enter largely residential neighborhoods. The landscape of the site, which appears to be minimal given the sheer mass of the structure, is roughly lined with shrubberies and sports a large tree that shields the front of the building from the traffic of the sidewalk and Avenue ahead. Though the constant vehicle and pedestrian traffic significantly detract from the residential value of the mansion, the commercial value of the structure has blossomed through the years. Its fun and intriguing form, however, continues to be a point of visual interest for the observant passerby. </p><p><br></p><p><a href="#_ftnref1" target="_blank">[1]</a> Elizabeth Mills Brown, <em>New Haven: A Guide</em>, 44.</p><p><a href="#_ftnref2" target="_blank">[2]</a> Elizabeth Mills Brown, <em>New Haven: A Guide</em>, 44.</p><p><a href="#_ftnref3" target="_blank">[3]</a> Elizabeth Mills Brown, <em>New Haven: A Guide</em>, 44.</p><p><br></p>','<p>	What is now the bold Queen Anne mansion on 357 Whitney Avenue began as a design by New Haven architect William H. Allen. Though the life and work of Allen remain relatively obscure, his career in New Haven produced some of the city’s most recognizable buildings, including the New Haven County Courthouse that today faces the New Haven Green. Still, over the course of his life, Allen designed nearly 500 buildings, most of which are in New Haven, East Haven, West Haven, Branford, Milford, and California.<a href="#_ftn1" target="_blank">[1]</a> According to Steve Wemlinger, Allen’s great-grandson, Allen’s crowing work is Plymouth Church (today Plymouth Medical Building), a massive stone structure on the corner of Chapel Street and Sherman Avenue.<a href="#_ftn2" target="_blank">[2]</a> In addition to these large New Haven monuments, Allen produced hundreds of smaller residential buildings that are found throughout the greater New Haven area.</p><p>	Upon its completion in 1897, Allen’s plan for 357 Whitney served as a statement home for its first owner and occupant, a prominent real estate broker named Lemuel G. Hoadley (not to be confused with the famous New Haven architect David Hoadley, nor the blacksmith sharing the same name from Waterbury, Connecticut). During the time of its construction, the lower Whitney neighborhood was a prime location for New Haven’s wealthiest residents—as mentioned by Elizabeth Mills Brown, the coming of the horsecar and sewer caused Whitney to erupt as city professionals moved farther from their downtown workplaces.<a href="#_ftn3" target="_blank">[3]</a> Hoadley, whose real estate office operated on Church Street, lived in the mansion until around 1940. After 1940, it appears Hoadley bequeathed the house to a relative, F. A. Hoadley, who remained the sole owner of the home until 1957. Between 1957 and 1959, the mansion was left entirely vacant, a time during which it seems many interior renovations took place, as the mansion transformed from a largely residential space to one serving the commercial needs of local businesses. </p><p>	Immediately following this transformation, the house was purchased in 1960 by H. A. Conte, a New Haven doctor. Though left unspecified by the records, it is likely that the house served as the location of Conte’s practice through 1970. Between 1970 and 1980, 357 Whitney developed into the orthodontic office of A. L. Gans. By 1980, the building was purchased by the law firm of Parrett, Porto &amp; Parese. Parrett, Porto and Parese operated their practice out of the building through 2000. Today, the structure is occupied by nineteen current tenants, including Healing Hearts LLC and Meilin LMT—at the moment, the building has three spaces available for rent on its first floor. Now a prime (though notably peculiar) commercial location, 357 Whitney stands as a monument to the audacious architectural style of twentieth century New Haven—even more so, however, it stands as a testament to the architectural talent of the mysterious New Haven local, William H. Allen. </p><p><br></p><p><a href="#_ftnref1" target="_blank">[1]</a> Randall Beach, “Meet New Haven’s greatest unknown architect,” <em>New Haven Register</em> (New Haven, CT), June 4, 2011.</p><p><a href="#_ftnref2" target="_blank">[2]</a> Randall Beach, “Meet New Haven’s,” 2011.</p><p><a href="#_ftnref3" target="_blank">[3]</a> Elizabeth Mills Brown, <em>New Haven: A Guide</em>, 44.</p><p><br></p>','<p>	Today, the William H. Allen house is enveloped by extensive commercial, residential, and institutional structures—however, at the time of its completion in 1897, it was one of the pioneering buildings on Whitney Avenue. Still remaining on its original construction site, the urban landscape around the building has changed dramatically through the years. As written by Elizabeth Mills Brown in <em>New Haven, a Guide to Architecture and Urban Design</em>, the coming of the horsecar and sewer systems to New Haven caused what is now lower Whitney to erupt with “…great brick houses and baronial castles, becoming the patrician showplace of the city.”<a href="#_ftn1" target="_blank">[1]</a> However, as the commercial value of Whitney rose with its proximity to downtown New Haven, the Avenue transformed from one of residential sophistication to a busy commercial hotspot.</p><p>	This transformation brought along great shifts in architectural style. The location itself “…began to lose ground after World War I,” as prestigious institutional buildings moved “…discreetly in among the mansions,” only to be followed by “…commercial uses and drab apartments.”<a href="#_ftn2" target="_blank">[2]</a> As the lower half of main Whitney transitioned from residential to commercial use, the site of 357 managed to maintain its original structure and value. However, such required the building to shift from residential to commercial purpose. Once an elaborate mansion for a wealthy New Haven professional, the building now serves local commerce, as is made evident by its social history. The Sanborn Fire Maps, pictured below, reveal the gradual development of Whitney Avenue over the course of the twentieth century.</p><p><br></p><p><a href="#_ftnref1" target="_blank">[1]</a> Elizabeth Mills Brown, <em>New Haven: A Guide</em>, 44.</p><p><a href="#_ftnref2" target="_blank">[2]</a> Elizabeth Mills Brown, <em>New Haven: A Guide</em>, 44.</p><p><br></p>','<p><strong><u>1897-1930s:</u></strong> The original structure is built by William H.

The restaurant established at 177 Park Street has thus been the result of this demographic shift, and has served as a anchor point through which one can observe the changing demographic of the city. This anchor point provides a dining hub that encourages the union of locals, newcomers, and students alike as they meet and interact over meals. Similarly, the locksmith shop provides a local meeting point as well, though one brought out of necessity more so than desire to interact.</p>','<p>The plot of land is contained in the Dwight-Edgewood neighborhood, off of the corner of Park and Chapel Streets. The 1888 Sanborn map shows an empty plot of land in the current place of 177 Park, while the 1911 Sanborn Map shows a rectangular building that resembles the one at the site today (See Images 2 and 3)<sup>6,7</sup>. However, there is no record of the building at 177 Park Street on the New Haven Tax Assessor Database prior to 1981, making the question of ownership difficult to answer<sup>1,5</sup>. The building was acquired by an unknown entity on October 8<sup>th</sup>, 1981; this entity owned it until February 1<sup>st</sup>, 1995, at which point a man by the name of William Esposito acquired 177 Park. Mr. Esposito maintained ownership until February 17<sup>th</sup>, 2012, when the building was transferred into the hands of <span style="background-color: white; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">WTE 1166 CHAPEL LLC. This change of hands likely corresponds to a pedagogical change in legal ownership, as one of the businesses occupying 177 Park (“La Cosinita”) has maintained a foothold in the building since 2005</span><sup style="background-color: white; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">2</sup><span style="background-color: white; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">.&nbsp;</span></p>','<p>The building is located in the heart of the Dwight-Edgewood neighborhood, which makes up a portion of New Haven’s residential area. 177 Park is surrounded on both sides by large, 3-story red-brick buildings in the 1890 Queen Anne Victorian style<sup>4</sup>. The surroundings are vibrant due to the close proximity of a college campus, the copious shops and businesses adjacent to the residential areas of young professionals, and the use of Chapel Street as a major throughway for transportation by car in New Haven. The plot of land associated with the building itself is situated just off of the main avenue of action, meaning that it maintains an active yet quiet presence.&nbsp;</p>','<p>The one-story building is situated one plot of land away from the corner of Park and Chapel street. It sits squarely in the middle of its plot, with two inaccessible alleyways bridging the gaps between the building and those adjacent to it on both sides. 177 Park Street boasts a modest grey brick exterior, with a thin black asphalt roof. The design in very much minimalist – no ornamentation, fenestration, or other cosmetic features are observable from the outside (See Image 2).&nbsp;</p>');

Haight, Phelps Gate/Phelps Hall is considered to be the main entrance to Yale University’s campus.&nbsp;Phelps Hall is a five-storied, monumental Victorian Gothic building that is distinguished by Phelps Gate -- a grand, intricately detailed, Tudor style, wrought iron gate that cuts under it.&nbsp;Through its entry, Phelps Gate creates a passageway from the city of New Haven to the private, cloistered campus of Yale University.&nbsp;The façade of Phelps Hall is composed of brick and stone, intended to complement the two preexisting, low-rise, brick dormitories to which it is connected; however, its unique trimmings and grand scale allow it to stand apart from its homogeneous, neighboring brick buildings as a monumental entrance to Yale’s campus.&nbsp;Phelps Hall currently houses Yale University’s Classics department.&nbsp;</p>','5','<p>Yale University (1896-Present)</p>','<p>This five story, Victorian Gothic building with its iconic gate is composed of brick and stone and has a flat roof. Four “flanking polygonal turrets” that are “kept absolutely solid and unbroken from base to parapet,” topped with copper caps with finials, jut out from the four corners of the building to add to its monumental presence (1).&nbsp;Above the archway on the College Street façade of the building is a “sash-frame” inscribed with “Lux et Veritas” that enhances the “three storied oriel” that spans from the keystone of the arch through the fourth floor (1).&nbsp;The roof features a Medieval-style parapet. The Yale University Old Campus-facing façade displays two ornamental turret-shaped pilasters that span the bottom three stories and are decorative and non-structural.&nbsp;Phelps Gate, a black, wrought iron gate, is encircled by a Tudor-style gateway and is perhaps the most impressive aspect of the building. The archway was specifically designed to be as grand as possible while still supporting the mass of Phelps Hall (1).&nbsp;Detailed and decorative acanthus leaf carvings surround the opening arch on both facades of the building and announce the importance of the structure to all who enter. </p><p><br></p><p>When constructed in 1896, Phelps Hall was equipped with heating, steam, lighting, and electricity (2).&nbsp;In 1965, the interior was updated with fire alarms, electrical fixtures, a fire escape, plumbing, library furniture, air conditioning, and a Payne elevator (3).&nbsp;Electronic security and control systems were implemented in 1984 as part of Yale University’s effort to increase security on campus (3).&nbsp;</p>','<p>Phelps Hall and its impressive arch sits on the former Brick Row of Yale University’s Old Campus. It was the last building constructed on the row of Old Campus buildings facing the New Haven Green (4).&nbsp;Thus, Phelps Hall/Phelps Gate “forms the central entrance to the campus from the city through an arched walkway” (4).&nbsp;</p>','<p>Phelps Hall/Phelps Gate was constructed by Yale University in 1896 and funded by the family of W. W. Phelps upon Phelps’ death (5).&nbsp;Built during Yale President Timothy Dwight’s administration, the building serves as a gateway between greater New Haven and Yale University’s central campus (6).&nbsp;The societal implications of the construction of Phelps Hall -- as well as its neighboring buildings erected at the same time period -- were substantial: “along with Sturgis’ Lawrence Hall of 1886, his Battell Chapel of 1876, Haight’s Vanderbilt Hall of 1894 and Phelps Hall, the buildings served to enclose Yale’s Old Campus, creating a substantial interior court and, most significantly, cutting the university off from the city,” separating the private from the public (7).&nbsp;At various points over the last century, Phelps Gate has been barricaded, further cloistering Yale from the New Haven community that surrounds it.&nbsp;For example, in 1918, Phelps Gate was closed to quarantine and “protect” the Yale community from the influenza pandemic that, as in other cities and towns across the United States, was sweeping though the New Haven community (8).&nbsp;In 1976, Phelps Gate was barricaded as a security-measure after several female Yale students were reportedly sexually assaulted in their dormitories by outside intruders (9).&nbsp;Then in 1984, additional electronic security systems were put in place to even further barricade Old Campus from its New Haven surroundings.&nbsp;From then until present, access to through the Gate requires electronic swipe access after 9 pm, although it remains open during the day.</p>','<p>Phelps Hall/Phelps Gate was constructed on an open piece of land on Yale’s Old Campus.&nbsp;No other building stood on that land prior to the building’s construction.&nbsp;Upon completion, Phelps Hall was “put to practical use as a ‘recitation building,’” but it is presently used as the Classics Department office building (10).&nbsp;The building is now comprised of Professor and administrative offices as well as seminar-style rooms for class use.&nbsp;</p>','<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Montgomery Schuyler, <em>A Review of the Work of Chas.

The building is a highly rectilinear structure, based around a main block with two towers. The smaller tower is to the back, seemingly emulating a chimney flue, and the larger is a bell tower that stands tall a small distance in front of the main face of the building. This bell tower emulates that of a traditional church but has a flat roof instead of a spire, and every level is left open for inspection through a cutaway corner next to the inset door. On the other side of the door, a dark wooden cross is affixed to the wall, balancing the structure and adding interest to the windowless front face. The exterior is covered in contemporary style brickwork of roughly cut light stone, irregularly jutting out from the surface, and a band of square concrete blocks sits atop the walls. (1) The northern wall also holds a single stained glass window, which is a rectangular bay with irregular panels of varying colors, adding a bright flourish to the nave.</p>','40\' x 60\'','2','<p>The building was designed for Calvary Baptist Church and has not changed hands.</p>','<p>The church is surrounded by residential buildings on the edge of the Dwight Street Historic District, an irregularly shaped district comprising roughly 20 commercial and residential blocks. (2) A key feature of the district is its high proportion of Victorian residential architecture, (2) from which Calvary Baptist Church sets itself apart with its distinctly contemporary style. </p>','<p>Calvary Baptist Church grew from an initiative established by the First Baptist Church in 1860 at 179 Dwight Street, originally solely a mission Sunday school. This Sunday school became its own branch church, which then became Calvary Baptist Church on the corner of York and Chapel Streets. (3) In 1892, Calvary planted a Chinese Sunday school that began its Chinese ministry in New Haven and grew over the next century. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Due to residential changes within the congregation, especially those of older members, they decided to sell the church building to Yale University in 1967, in order to build a smaller, more modern place of worship. (4) Construction began at the current location of 100 Dwight Street almost immediately, and the church moved in officially on November 23<sup>rd</sup> 1969. (3) The building committee was advised by Rev. A. King Boutwell under the chairmanship of D. N. Prescott. (5) The committee worked closely with the local architectural firm Lee &amp; Crabtree Associates of Hartford to create a place of worship that reflected the needs of the congregation as closely as possible. (5) The estimated construction cost was $207,500 for a 2-story masonry structure with an integrated bell tower. Also in the designs was a fellowship hall with a kitchen, a library, administrative offices and Sunday school classrooms. The plans even provided for expansion into the second floor by leaving this section unfinished during initial construction, (5) giving the congregation more room to develop their mission under their new roof.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>While construction was underway, Yale University quickly moved into the old space, an 1871 Gothic revival building designed by Rufus G. Russell (6) on the site of New Haven founder Richard Platt’s original home. (7) Within a year the building became the first and only site of the newly founded Yale Repertory Theatre. (3) Since its opening, the Repertory Theatre has seen over 100 premieres, 2 Pulitzer Prize winners and 17 productions that advanced to Broadway winning 10 Tony awards. (8)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Two years after construction was completed, in 1971 or Chinese year 4669, the year of the pig, Calvary Baptist Church installed its first full-time Chinese pastor, Rev. Fai Szeto. (9) At this point, they were the only church still ministering to the Chinese population of New Haven, with Sunday afternoon services in Mandarin and Cantonese, as well as a Friday bible study group and Chinese Christian Fellowship. (9) In 1994 the Chinese congregation inherited the CBCNH ministry and continues to witness to the gospel in the Greater New Haven area. (3)</p>','<p>The previous building on the 100 Dwight Street site appeared between 1893 and 1901 (10) (11) and was a Victorian residential construction made of wood belonging to L. A. Coe, with a brick outbuilding at the rear. (12) Before this, the site was empty. (13)</p>','<p>(1)<em> Historic Resources Inventory Form for 100 Dwight Street.</em> Pdf.

To complement the church’s grandeur aesthetic, there are in the building’s narrowly arched windows and generally darker stone pediments remnants of a Neo-gothic style, giving the church a more imposing and almost menacing texture during grayer or darker days. </span></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The church is located in a residential street just out of reach from Yale’s downtown radius, in the outskirts of New Haven’s Chapel West area. It is surrounded by wooden frame houses and apartment buildings home to Yale students as well as native New Haven residents. </span></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">At its time of construction in 1941, the building was originally named St. Barbara’s Greek Orthodox Church. It was paid for completely by New Haven’s Greek immigrant population through donations ranging from $125 to $1500 after the previous Greek Orthodox church on Beers Street had been ravaged by a fire. The new church on Dwight Street became a symbol of optimism; of a phoenix rising from the ashes. Due to the reason the new church was constructed and the “crowd-sourcing” process by which it was funded, the structure became a powerful symbol of Greek solidarity and community in the city. The building cost about $60,000 to build and was consecrated the next year on Easter Sunday of 1942. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">For over 40 years, the church served uninterrupted until it was sold to Ebenezer Chapel Inc. in 1985. The members of the church had split into two factions, and ended up in court. When the church was sold and changed its designation from Orthodox to Pentecostal, most of the congregation moved to Orange, CT. The ones who stayed rented space in the Center Church on the Green for a short time. It was not until September 2017 that the New Haven Greek population established an Orthodox place of worship in founding St. Basil’s Greek Orthodox Church in Elm City. &nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Ebenezer Chapel now has a pentecostal congregation and serves primarily African Americans in the New Haven area both through its Sunday sermons and through its Sunday School and charity work in the community. </span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The building was constructed in 1941, so it did not exist in the 1901 Sanborn map. What was there instead was a row of wooden residential houses that were mostly cleared to make room for the church. There was one house left untouched, which has been the Parish House for both incarnations of the church and is still standing to this day. The eliminating of several houses except for one (and incorporating it as the church’s parish house) may account for why the church’s address is so variable. The tax assessor’s office has the chapel under 48 Dwight Street, but the owner has it under 56 Dwight Street. However, Google Maps and the Ebenezer Chapel Website list the address as 50 Dwight Street. </span></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VcW6911ouNPMKVTa6Ah_G9CDBsLnrp0A?usp=sharing</span></p>');

The bricks of the exterior wall are arranged in a running bond pattern and show little erosion. In the upper portion of the structure, three equally-spaced garden windows divide the space, and smaller, double-hung windows fill the areas in between. Disrupting the otherwise symmetrical front façade are gutters that are mildly rusted. The unassuming and reserved nature of the two circle-top doors, one at the extreme left of the front wall and the other slightly inward from the rightmost edge, indicate that the structure may have been entirely residential in its early stages. Today the doors still serve as entryways to the apartment spaces atop the lower retail floor. The roof is hipped and covered in T&amp;G/Rubber. The interior walls consist of painted drywall and plaster. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Café Romeo’s recently renovated storefront sits slightly to the left of the building’s center and evokes a sense of modernity in the patron- shiny metal-framed, floor-length windows allow pedestrians to see into the space and seemingly flow from the patio area to the interior. The sign was constructed with the same glossy material and orchestrated by local designer Ted Salmon. Consistent with the architectural history of other buildings in the East Rock neighborhood (3), 534 Orange St. has likely undergone little if no remodeling since its construction in 1915. According to one employee at Café Romeo, removing the light-up sign for Bunnell’s Paint and Hardware in 2009 was the biggest aesthetic change that most locals had seen occur to the structure. This prospect is consistent with the architectural history of other buildings in the East Rock Neighborhood which have remained almost entirely untouched throughout the 20<sup>th</sup> and 21<sup>st</sup> centuries (3). Café Romeo shares the property with JJ Cleaners which, although it has a relatively maintained storefront, has preserved the light-up sign and window posters that appeal to early 20<sup>th</sup> century mom-and-pop shops. The stone patio in the front of the structure opens up the property’s space and provides an area for community members to interact with each other and observe the surrounding residential area.</p>','<p>Café Romeo sits on a tranquil corner on the edge of the neighborhood of East Rock and is nestled among many single and multi-family homes as well as some that have been converted into businesses. The patio separates the coffee shop from the surrounding streets and provides a buffer from traffic which generates a relaxed atmosphere for patrons. Just steps away from the Yale School of Management and the New Haven Lawn Club, Café Romeo is constantly fluttering with lively visitors of all ages, many of them regulars who the baristas have come to know well (3). East Rock is considered an upper-middle income neighborhood.</p>','<p>The building at 534 Orange Street was built in 1915. Café Romeo lies in the southwestern portion of East Rock which is characterized for having avoided the invasive demolition and redevelopment that other areas of New Haven have been exposed to (4). While the district has largely maintained the original residences built in the late 19<sup>th</sup> to early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries, Orange Street has witnessed some of these properties be converted to non-residential use, likely the case for unit 534. In 1951, the property was converted into Bunnell Paint for which no owner’s name seems to exist in New Haven’s records. The store specialized in selling paint and wallpaper, achieving relative success for its ability to conveniently provide community members with products before major supply businesses began to appear (1). </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In 1975, milkman-turned-businessman Len Mullaly bought the paint store and converted it into a hybrid hardware shop which became a neighborhood staple for East Rock residents throughout the years. At its peak, Bunnell Paint and Hardware boasted having Yale as a major client back when the university bought art materials in bulk (1). The shop’s trend of success dwindled and led Mullally to ultimately sell the much-beloved business to current owner Christopher Mordecai in 2009.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The following September, Mordecai opened the doors of Café Romeo, his first venture into food and retail (2). The receptive semblance of the store, resting upon the only discernibly open slab of pavement on the block, welcomes and provides a natural meeting point for locals in the surrounding residential area. Current employees emphasize that the café provides the ideal stopping point for professionals on their way to work, students looking to study, and pedestrians searching for a place to grab a meal (3). Bike racks that facilitate the transportation of patrons and avoid producing traffic were installed both in consultation with the City of New Haven as well as by local sculptor Ted Salmon (2). Mordecai makes possible the establishment of a dynamic public space by making the patio pet-friendly, Wi-Fi free for students, and the café wheelchair accessible. The inside of Café Romeo is regularly decorated with the works of local artists that he promotes free of charge. Café Romeo not only evokes the same small town feel as the businesses before it, but it functions as a local gathering place and maintains East Rock as a tight knit community as opposed to a business-driven district. </p>','<p>The building that today accommodates units 528-534 on Orange Street first appeared on a Sanborn map in 1924, but it was originally built in 1915. The commissioner of the original building is unknown as is the purpose(s) for which the property was used between its construction and 1951 when it became Bunnell Paint (1). It is reasonable to believe that the building went through few changes between its time as Bunnell Paint and then as also a hardware store under Len Mullally. The most large-scale renovation took place in 2009 when Christopher Mordecai, Bernard Massaro Jr., and Romeo Simeone purchased the unit from Mullally to launch Café Romeo and subsequently changed the storefront as well as the front terrace.</p>','<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allan Appel, “Sun Sets On Neighborhood Hardware Store” October 17, 2008, <em>New Haven Independent.</em></p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allan Appel, "Hardware Store Reborn As Sidewalk Cafe" August 10, 2009, <em>New Haven Independent.</em></p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interview with Two Employee at Café Romeo, February 23 2018.</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National Register for Historic Places Inventory, Orange Street Historic District, 2, 5-6.</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Untitled Document, New Haven City Hall Assessor\'s Office.</p>');

Crafted entirely of rusty-red brick stone and beige-colored traprock, the façade appears symmetrical in form and entices potential customers with its Ivy- League feel (1). Upon closer look, however, the building’s balance is often broken— randomly dispersed beige stones interrupt the continuity of the building’s rusty-red tessellation-like brick pattern (1). This asymmetrical design on both facades heightens the “boldness” of the commercial site, and its randomness is mirrored with the architect’s choice to construct three and a half stories, rather than an even four (1). The store’s historically consistent commercial use is evoked with the large glass windows that line the first floor of both facades; one on the York Street façade and five on the Broadway façade.&nbsp;</p>','3.5','1,200 Square Feet (4).','<p>1927 – Built for David Langrock, Langrock Fine Clothing (2).</p><p>1976 – Switched to M Co Men’s Clothing – Owned by Arthur Rosenberg (5).</p><p>1994 – 2003 – Barrie’s Ltd. Booters (6).</p><p>2010 – Present - GANT&nbsp;</p>','<p>The structure’s sharply pointed facade pierces the sky, asserting its dominance as York Street’s historic locus of high fashion. Rising three and a half floors, each level on the York Street facade is demarcated with its own unique window-style. The first floor sports a large, horizontal window for showcasing fashions. The other floors flaunt smaller, more vertical windows, which seem to intensify the perception of the structure’s height as viewers peer into the sky. Similarly matching with this theme, the windows on the Broadway façade become smaller and more vertical with each successive floor. The “hip-roof dormers” on the cable roof prove functional and ornamental, connecting the slate-shingled roof with the façade (1). This cable roof barely hangs over the structure, emphasizing the connection between the structure and its “hat” (7). The structure’s site is historically at the “juncture of academic and commercial areas,” and its ornamentation and design suggest the intersection of pragmatic and chic (1). The store’s formulaic, classic brick design is broken with a multi-layered, concrete entablature that wraps around the entirety of the structure, nodding to classic Greek design and heightening the structure’s didactic themes (1). The York Street façade also emphasizes the connection of the academic with the stylish, and an elaborate ornamental shield highlights the meeting of windows—this shield evokes Yale’s “crest,” as if done-up in a more fashionable, ornamental way (1). Collegiate designs follow to the top of the pointed façade, where three classic, stone stripes and a pointed accent top the structure. Worn down, original wood interior remains intact, serving as internal ornamentation that asserts the historic prestige of the site (1).&nbsp;</p>','<p>At the corner of York Street and Elm Street, the store marks the start of the Broadway commercial district: an area dedicated to upholding the Ivy League look (8). Less than 20 feet away and sitting directly across from the site, Broadway is lined with Patagonia, Barbour, and J. Crew, all shops accompanying GANT’s classic, pretentious prep. TYCO, a local printing shop, separates GANT from a future L.L. Bean store— thus, even the developing sites fit GANT’s historic, male-centric fashion theme.&nbsp;</p>','<p>As a New Haven icon, the Langrock Building sits atop a long history of both gender and socioeconomic inequality. Mirroring Yale University’s 20th century development as a predominantly masculine space, the Langrock Building advanced as a site primarily for the refinement of the “Yale male” (8). While the university went coeducational in 1969 (with the exception of the “Fine Arts School,” which had been coeducational since 1869), 268 York Street maintained paternalistic associations of “male education” even after women were admitted (9,10).</p><p><br></p><p>David Langrock, the original client for the production of the Tudor-Revival structure, laid the foundation for the site’s paternal associations in 1927, when he presented the University with the task of “reviewing the architectural plans” for his new store (2). James Gamble, the official “University architect” at the time, declared the plans must “conform with present and future Yale buildings” (2). Essentially, Gamble asserted the site must be constructed as a natural extension of the existing campus, indistinguishable in style from other Yale structures (2). In doing so, Gamble physically joined Yale with Langrock fashions—as if to suggest the preppy fashions as a uniform for the Yale male student. The original structure was a haven for all things preppy—the basement held the clothing store, while the other floors were filled with “haberdashery,” hats, shoes, and custom tailoring (2). The original store even had a barbershop (2). Langrock dedicated his store to the belief that “men should dress in a style fitting their station in life,” a phrase further emphasizing the necessity of collegiate “style” for the elite, Ivy-League man (2). Langrock, however, entirely ignores the woman (2).</p><p><br></p><p>As Langrock expanded his efforts into Princeton and other top universities, his New Haven location suffered and was ultimately replaced by M. Co. Men’s Clothing in 1976 and Barrie’s Booters in 1994 (5, 6, 8). While little is known about M. Co. Men’s Clothing and its styles, the declaration of the site as primarily for “Men” fits strongly with Langrock’s male-centric styles. Similarly, Barrie’s Booters Ltd. entered New Haven as part of a tradition of “men’s stores,” offering no options for female Yale students (6). The site’s contemporary tenant, GANT, fits with this timeline of paternal fashion, and while GANT offers select female styles, the store promotes itself as selling “Men’s Shirts, Blazers for Men and Clothing”—with no mention of women (11). Thus, while the site historically served as a commercial hub, it stands as a site of restriction and gender inequality.</p><p><br></p><p>Originally as a multi-use space, the site attracted significant traffic, paving the way for the structure as a central, communal and commercial hub. However, the community fostered within the space was largely restricted to elite, wealthy Yale students—not the New Haven community at large (8). Spatially, the structure’s association with privilege is heightened by its place within campus; rather than sitting in a more universally accessible spot in downtown New Haven, the Langrock Building is tucked conveniently between Branford College and Davenport College (both of which carry Yale’s pretentious aura) (12). The Langrock Building sat next to J. Press for years, another store with pricey offerings—the combination of the two intimidated the New Haven landscape (8). Socioeconomically, the attire offered was for the elite of the elite—prices were high and virtually unattainable to the lower classes (8). The contemporary landscape fits with the historical timeline of inaccessibility—although J.Press has closed, the GANT store produces “upscale” label clothing for students and wealthy residents willing to spend (11). Despite these downfalls, the Langrock Building proves a local monument, and GANT upholds the historical trends of its original occupants.&nbsp;</p>','<p>	Prior to holding the center of New Haven’s male fashion scene, the site was similarly commercial, frequently serving as a local pharmacy for the Broadway and York Street areas (13). The Langrock Building wasn’t constructed until 1927, but various drugs stores sat on the same site (13). An 1886 map of New Haven displays a structure for “Drugs” on site (13). This store’s layout barely shifts between 1886 and 1901, suggesting the permanence of the building as a central pharmacy for the area (13,14). </p><p><br></p><p>	The pharmacy narrative is maintained throughout the early 20th century, and in 1910, a dark wood drugstore stood at the intersection of York and Elm, likely owned by I.L. Sanford, B.R. Ward or C.P. Wilson, who were all listed as owners of the site in 1911 (15,16). The structure had a cabin-like shape, a white scalloped overhang, and a large commercial sign that read “DRUGS” (15). In a 1910 image of 268 York Street, crowds of people stood under the overhang, suggesting the pharmacy as a popular site of social interaction (15). This structure frequently switched hands in the early 20th century, owned by Colburn’s York Pharmacy in 1917 and Lichter’s York Pharmacy in 1921 (17,18). </p><p><br></p><p>	In 1924, only three years before the emergence of the Langrock Building, the site had significantly expanded its square footage, with additional structures behind the York Street façade (potentially for expanded distribution or manufacturing) (19). Thus, over the course of the late 19th century and early 20th century, the site held a similar commercial and social power to its more contemporary counterparts, as it was frequently passed between the hands of various pharmacy owners.&nbsp;</p>','<p>1.

Situated within the Historic Ninth Square district, the building has been home to a variety of retail businesses and services since the late 1800s.

The Art Deco style is especially notable through building’s flat monochromatic masonry façade and the stepped-edge recess geometric motif surrounding the second-floor window (1). The building, in its recently vacated state today, shows some signs of deterioration of the outer masonry, as well as some graffiti near the top of the second floor’s exterior. Perhaps most prominently, the building’s first floor signage block is showing deep deterioration, speaking to the long history of commercial businesses that have inhabited the space, installed signage, and then vacated the premises. </p><p><br></p><p>However, the building in its current construction has only stood since 1945. In the early 1900s, 786 Chapel Street housed a two-story commercial building built in a neo-classical style. This building was part of a series of commercial buildings on Chapel Street that composed the “Old Marble Block” (2). The exterior featured a light marble façade with a series of nine windows, four of which were covered by neoclassical angular and segmental arches. This can be seen in a photo from 1925, included in the image gallery above. This building was destroyed in a fire that consumed both 784 and 786 Chapel Street on Christmas Day in 1944 (3) and was rebuilt by 1945 in the style seen today.&nbsp;</p>','<p>786 Chapel Street is located within the dense commercial setting of Downtown New Haven’s Ninth Square District. The area is highly transited by both pedestrians and vehicles and includes a popular bus stop only a block away from the building. The buildings in the surrounding area are composed of a variety of retail shops, a large specialty grocery store, several bars and restaurants, as well as a post office. The variety of shops and services offered in the district make it attractive as a residential spot as well, resulting in a host of luxury apartment buildings interspersed among and sometimes above the commercial stores. The existence of both essential services such as the bus stop, post office, and grocery store and the nightlife options of bars and restaurants ensure that the area is highly transited at most hours of the day.&nbsp;</p>','<p>786 Chapel Street has a long history of contributing to the growth of New Haven’s downtown retail district as a center of local commerce. From the construction of the original building as part of a series of commercial buildings referred to as the “Marble Block” (also occasionally known as the Central Block) c.1900, the building has been home to a host of local retail businesses. 786 Chapel Street’s original incarnation, designed in a neoclassical style by New Haven-bred architect Jacob Weinstein (4), speaks to a desire to portray a refined, cosmopolitan image of New Haven’s retail options. Looking at the building’s tenants from about 1913 to 1971, it becomes evident that 786 Chapel Street was often utilized as a small luxury clothing and fabric store, perhaps operating as an alternative (or complement) to the larger department stores around Chapel Street that also offered shoppers visions of consumption and taste.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The building’s second life, rebuilt post-fire in 1945 by the J.N Leonard Company (4), saw its continued significance in New Haven’s commercial downtown, albeit now with a subtle Art Deco exterior. Leaving behind the Old World neoclassical aesthetics of the angular and segmented window arches, 786 Chapel’s modern look reflected a shift toward providing services alongside products within the district. This shift toward services not only helped disassemble the homogenous vision of upper class consumption that had previously characterized the commercial district but can also be seen as an adaptation to New Haven’s growing and diversifying population. This is most clearly perceived through the building’s last two tenants: Artistic Beauty Design Curl HQ, who held the space from 1983 through 1997 (15), and Wireless Wizard, who recently vacated the building after a seven year tenure.</p><p><br></p><p>The vacancy that has just opened up at 786 Chapel Street speaks to the continual evolution of New Haven’s downtown commercial districts, where, somewhat more out of the reach of Yale’s influence and commercial interests, retail businesses’ success and longevity is at least in part dependent upon the needs of the greater population. Whoever the next tenant of 768 Chapel Street may be, they will continue to contribute to the long changing character of Chapel Street as one of New Haven’s oldest and most important mercantile hubs.</p>','<p>Prior to the construction of 786 Chapel Street’s commercial building, the site most likely held the home and workshop of blacksmith Theophilus Munson c.1786 (5). Chapel Street itself at this time consisted of a variety of both residences and the beginnings of compact business district. Alongside Munson, other early Chapel Street residents included among them dry goods merchants, grocers, and tailors.</p><p><br></p><p>The site also resides on one of the original nine squares originally set out at the time of New Haven’s founding (now known as the Ninth Square Historic District) (1). Thus, the site’s historic proximity to not only the city’s central public and civic space (the New Haven Green), but also to the harbor and its mercantile trade, made the land a prime location for the growth of a bustling commercial district.</p>','<p>1. “Ninth Square Historic District.”&nbsp;<em>United States Department of the Interior National Park Service: National Register of Historic Places Inventory--Nomination Form</em>.

It is easy to tell the school is a bit rundown by the aged window frames, front doors, and chain-link fence that surrounds the front of the building. However, the inside of the building has been recently renovated to maintain all educational conditions. The school currently serves as a 12-year academy for students who struggle financially in order to support and give them proper educational opportunities.&nbsp;</p>','95\' X 140\'','3+ attic&basement','<p>This building was originally constructed as a part of the Sacred Heart Community Complex involving a church, convent, rectory, and school all on one connected plot of land.&nbsp;</p>','<p>208 Columbus Avenue highlights a <strong>Renaissance Revival </strong>style building standing 3 stories tall with a <strong>low hip-roof </strong>made of <strong>asphalt shingles </strong>and a <strong>modillion cornice </strong>that forms a full <strong>pediment </strong>in the front 3 story <strong>center pavilion</strong>. The center pavilion encompasses the style of the building with a stylized <strong>Palladian window </strong>on the third floor, a <strong>brownstone fascia </strong>with the original school’s name “Sacred Heart” molded into it, and a large arched entryway. Made of <strong>brick and sandstone, </strong>the building remains in good structural condition and fair external condition considering that it retains all of its original integrity. Thus said, this building holds high standards as it is one of few 19th century school buildings to remain in its original state without having been modernized and condensed like many of its similar structures. Inside, the building has large, open classrooms with tall windows to provide natural lighting for the students, while on the outside each window is seen as a common 2x2 style window with <strong>brownstone heads and sills</strong>. The only alterations done to this structure are new fire doors in the rear of the building and interior design changes and remodeling. However, the new owners from the Saint Martin’s Academy hope to raise enough money to repair the old school building and expand by developing a playing field for an athletics program. (3,4)&nbsp;</p>','<p>The Saint Martin de Porres Academy stands in a residential neighborhood encompassed by a commercial business district with high building density alongside a nearby community park and health center. The building itself sits on a lot with the old Sacred Heart church, convent, rectory and a small outdoor basketball court which are all surrounded by a chain-link fence. A few blocks away lies the New Haven Police Headquarters and the New Haven Union Station, while a few blocks in the opposite direction lies the Boys and Girls Club of New Haven and the Yale New Haven Hospital.&nbsp;</p>','<p>This 19th century school was originally part of Sacred Heart parish, New Haven which was founded by St. John the Evangelist in hopes of creating a community whose focus was on religion and worship. In 1874, the pastor of the community, Father Hugh Carmody, bought and opened what was initially a congregational church for its first catholic mass. Over time, people began to flood into the community of Sacred Heart parish; so, in 1881 the second pastor of the church purchased acreage on Columbus Avenue for a future school and convent. However, it was not for another five years until 1886 that ground began to break in creation of these materialistic and religious additions. With a new pastor on site, Father McKeon, a rectory was built on the land in 1890, a school in 1894, and in 1897 the convent was finished. In fact, as the pastor’s first appearance for public action, he blessed the cornerstone of the school shortly before 675 students entered the school’s halls for the first time under the steady watch of the Sisters of Mercy. Additionally, during McKeon’s time as pastor, the Sacred Heart community flourished with different activities and groups engaging around the Hill neighborhood-including Children of Mary, Men’s League of the Sacred Heart, and the Catholic Club. </p><p>In 1939 after a major fire, the church was repaired while the other buildings on the lot remained intact. In 1946 however, there was a combined redecoration of the church, school, convent, and rectory in order to keep up with societal changes. After this redecoration, life continued to flourish in the area but it was not until the early 2000’s that life began to deteriorate for the Sacred Heart community. With heavy financial burdens, the school had to shut down, the convent was relocated, and the church itself could no longer afford the renovations to maintain the needed conditions. Luckily, in 2007 the old Sacred Heart school building was rented out to be a temporary home for the Saint Martin de Porres Academy and in July 2017, the school and its surrounding properties were purchased by the academy. (2) On the other hand, the church, convent, and rectory remain vacant only representing the original Sacred Heart parish that used to be. </p><p>The new academy which lives on 208 Columbus Avenue is a prime example of what the Hill neighborhood in New Haven represents. As the president of the academy stated in one of her opening statements to the public, the neighborhood is one of the “most underserved in New Haven” (3) and the academy has high hopes of increasing the educational standards for the area. The academy is for students with limited income and resources in order to support them throughout their primary school days to successfully get them to college. The academy also hopes to expand their school by building new athletic fields around the school site itself. (3)&nbsp;</p>','<p>This site has always been a part of a larger community of the Sacred Heart complex with a fellow church, convent, and rectory. Since the structure was built, there was a small amount of reconstruction in 1946 to add new fire doors and stairs. There has been no design change (only maintenance) to the exterior in order to maintain the 19th century school image.&nbsp;</p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">"A Brief History of Sacred Heart Parish."

The L-shaped apartment building sits neatly on its 0.4-acre lot with a shallow hip roof and cream-colored stucco walls. Upon approach, some of the apartment’s more refined details begin to emerge, like the triple grouping of round-top windows with their radiating panes and Doric pilasters, or the distinct flourishes of the bell-shaped gamble ends which are punctuated by a neat circular window. The façade is subtle yet highly ordered, with a string course around the second floor and an occasional blind arch above select windows. Although only two stories high, a sense of verticality is achieved by the soaring picturesque gambles as well as an irregular spacing of cornice brackets that align with the vertical edges of the windows. Massing, as well as a smart use of lines, makes the overall structure appear balanced and well organized.</p><p><br></p><p>The irregular footprint of the structure hosts an airy side-yard that almost functions as a courtyard. Entrances to the apartments are situated along this internal stretch and in the past there was a large pergola that framed the outer edge of the lot. Designed by landscape architect Fredrick Davis Jr. and documented across records for the property, the pergola featured column supports and a matching tile hip roof (13).&nbsp;The concrete base supports for the pergola remain in the yard despite the fact that none of the original structure remains.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>While there were once rain gutters running vertically along the street-front side of the building they have since been removed and staining from water runoff is now observable. Beyond a few patches of peeling paint on the window frames, there are few signs of physical decay.</p><p>  </p><p>&nbsp;</p>','<p>According to a 1981 entry in the Historical Resources Inventory, the Cordova Apartments building is a “sensitive addition to upper Orange St.” that “respects its neighbors” (13). Such a conclusion can be drawn from the fact that most of the surrounding residential buildings are from the mid to late 19<sup>th</sup> century and are only two or three stories tall. Unlike the new five-story brick apartment complexes built down the street, Cordova’s scale and picturesque massing complement the Second Empire and Queen Anne style dwellings that came before it. Thus it blends into its residential setting while adding to the neighborhood’s distinct and historically eclectic character.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Located on the same block as both St. Joseph’s Church and the Clifford Beers Guidance Clinic (formerly the Edward Street School), the Cordova Apartments situate tenants right in the heart of the neighborhood activity. An empty adjacent lot is especially convenient for tenants, serving as a grassy park for exercise and activities as well as providing extra light and air to the apartments that look out onto it. The spaciousness of the area is a welcome respite from some of the urban crowding experienced elsewhere on the street.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>','<p>Jacob Weinsten was the architect behind the Cordova Apartments (13). A well-respected member of the Architects’ League of New Haven, Weinstein immigrated to America from Russia as a boy in 1892 before attending New Haven’s public schools and eventually graduating from Yale College. His architectural firm located at No. 6 Church Street was responsible for various residential buildings including many of brick apartment buildings in the East Rock neighborhood (10).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Completed in 1921, Weinstein’s Spanish-Colonial-inspired complex was initially listed as the “Bungalow Apartments” in the city directory (1). All 11 of the building’s units were quickly occupied and some time in the first few years the name was switched to the “Cordova Apartments” (although the Sanborn maps consistently mislabel the structure as “Codova Apartments”) (11). In 1942 the complex was sold to Lester H. Brown for the price of $44,000 (8). By the time of the 1981 Historic Resources Inventory the property had again passed hands to David and Constance D’Atri (13). Today it is still owned by Constance D’Atri who lives in Guilford, Connecticut (14). </p><p> </p><p>A noticeable trend for the apartments is how tenants tend to inhabit the building over long periods of time—in some cases even passing the unit on to family members. For instance, directory records show that a ‘Mrs. S C Keane’ continuously occupied apartment no. 9 from at least 1944 through 1967 and by 1981 the apartment is listed under the name ‘Katherine C Keane’—most likely a daughter or relative (3,4,5,6). More research on the lives of the building’s many tenants still needs to be done.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Please refer to the “Past Tenants” section for a comprehensive list of the Cordova Apartments’ tenants over nearly the past hundred years. </p>','<p>The lot at 671-675 Orange Street has only ever hosted one building: the Cordova Apartments. Until construction began in 1921, the space sat unused for a number of years. Considerably larger than the surrounding residential plots, the 1911 Atlas of New Haven shows that the land was part of the much larger estate holdings of the late Pierrepont Beers Foster (1811-1886). A New Haven native, P. B. Foster already came from a wealthy family but acquired much land after the death of his first wife Stella L. Bishop (7). Coincidentally, today both families have streets named after them. </p><p><br></p><p>Maps indicate that Foster held most of the plots along Foster Street and upper Orange Street at the time of his death. Today, nearly all of them have been developed with the notable exception of 657 Orange Street. The land adjacent to the Cordova Apartments was the original site of William L. Foster’s house. William, the son of Stella and Pierrepont, built a three-story wooden frame home on the land in 1871. Upon his wife’s death the home was inherited by their son, Major Pierrepont B. Foster, who subsequently sold it to St. Joseph’s parish in late 1940 (9). By 1945, the address is listed as “St. Joseph’s Community Center” in the city directory but newspapers clippings from the Dana Collection reveal that the property was sold that very same year to the Trustees from the first Methodist Episcopal Church of New Haven (3,9). Some time during the next decade, the original structure was demolished and the lot has remained vacant ever since.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>','<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1921 New Haven Directory, Vol. 81 (The Price &amp; Lee Co.)</p><p><br></p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1924-25 New Haven Directory, Vol. 84 (The Price &amp; Lee Co.)</p><p><br></p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1945-45 New Haven Directory, Vol. 105 (The Price &amp; Lee Co.)</p><p><br></p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1955 New Haven Directory, Vol. 115 (The Price &amp; Lee Co.)</p><p><br></p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1967 New Haven Directory, Vol. 127 (The Price &amp; Lee Co.)</p><p><br></p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1981 City Directory: New Haven, Connecticut.</p><p><br></p><p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cutter, William Richard (ed.), “New England Families, Genealogical and Memorial: A Record of the Achievements of Her People in the Making of Commonwealths and the Founding of a Nation, Volume 3” (New York: Lewis Historical Publishing Company, 1913)</p><p><br></p><p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dana Collection: Bk. 39, p. 42. </p><p><br></p><p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dana Collection: Bk. 39, p. 38-41. </p><p><br></p><p>10.&nbsp;Hill, Everett Gleason, “A Modern History of New Haven and Eastern New Haven County, Volume 2” (New York: The S.

Since its construction in 1910, the building has served as an apartment complex, though its tenants have evolved from New Haven working-people to mainly Yale students. While its tenants have changed, the building itself has largely remained the same. The façade of this four-story, late Romanesque revival building is composed of cut stone, whereas the sides and rear, which extend far into the lot, are made of brick. The building is largely associated with the next-door Cambridge Arms building, as the two are both owned by Cambridge Oxford LLC.</p>','44\' x 108\'','Four floors and a basement.','<p>The Oxford has housed various people over the years, and the nature of the record-keeping in the New Haven City Directories would imply that these individuals are mostly living without a family. These directories, from 1939, 1955, 1961, and 1970 would imply that there was a greater population of people living in these apartments that lived and worked in New Haven, rather than attended Yale University. Various such tenants include Teresa L. Baker (personal shopper, 1955), John Powers (janitor, 1939), and A J Hardy (nurse, 1955). In addition, it appears most of the apartments could be filled, as there were very few vacancies in any of the records searched.</p>','<p>This building is an impressive sight on the relatively narrow High Street and requires crossing onto the opposite side to get a complete view of the building. The building has a relatively uniform structure, anchored by an arched entrance made of the same random, rockface ashlar stone blocks which compose the rest of the front of the building. The Oxford is four stories tall with a flat roof and features four distinct columns of rectangular windows along its façade, separated horizontally by floor. The outer two columns of these windows are canted, while the middle two are flush with the façade. Along the sides of the building are brick and relatively homogenous, with windows laid mostly flush along the sides of the building. The one distinctive feature on the building’s side is another canted set of windows from the second to the fourth floor, likely made of some copper material due to its immense patina. Finally, the rear of the building is similarly made of brick, with windows arranged in a nearly identical fashion to the building’s façade, but without the canted columns adorning its sides.&nbsp;</p>','<p>On High Street, the Oxford sits in the center of a vibrant residential and commercial district, near other apartment buildings, fraternity houses, restaurants, and shops. While it certainly plays second fiddle in terms of stature to the Cambridge Arms building, it is certainly an imposing building on the street. The front façade of the building is laden with numerous windows, although the street it looks out upon is not particularly busy – it is a one-way and serves as a bridge between the more popular Chapel and Crown Streets. While the building does appear small in comparison to the Cambridge, walking around the building certainly demonstrates its size, with the rear extending far into its lot, and into a small parking lot with a rear entrance.&nbsp;</p>','<p>This building has served as an apartment building since its initial construction in 1910, although the people that this building has served has evolved over time. Based on preliminary research through the New Haven City Directories since the buildings construction (1939, 1955, 1961, and 1970, available at the New Haven Museum Library), the individuals who had occupied this space appeared to be middle to upper-middle class New Haven residents, some of whom probably worked at Yale University. As the building has evolved with new renovations and additions, including a sprinkler system and remodeled pavement in recent years, the building has attracted a more elite, student clientele. The building was recently sold in conjunction with the Cambridge Arms building next door to East River Partners, a New York real estate firm, for $22.5 million, approximately three times the appraised value of the buildings. Therefore, while the building used to serve as a broad-based apartment complex, it now serves as “premier off-campus living steps from Yale University”, with a wait list extending more than a year in advance.&nbsp;</p>','<p>Since 1910, the building has served as an apartment building, and no major exterior renovations have been done to change the shape of the building, or its relationship with the lot. The sides of the building are flush, however, as an initial expectation was for the further development of nearby properties. Before the building was constructed, the site housed a two-story residence, as suggested by a 1901 Sanborn map of the neighborhood. The construction of the apartment building in this residence’s place suggests the solidification of the street as a residential nexus, as it currently serves Yale and New Haven today.</p>','<p>Sanborn Map Company.

It is a three-story masonry building with a flat roof (2). The brick front façade of the building is adorned with a porch and awning supported by Corinthian columns, arching over two large red doors brandishing the fraternity’s Greek letters. There is particular reference to Greek temples with pediments and the elevated porch facing the street being displayed in white as almost a separate entity from the rest of the house, which is brick. On the left side of the house there is a second entrance made for access during social events, while the right side is home to a brick patio. Around the back of the house, there is an annexed structure with a roof terrace.</p><p>Over time, the house has been added to and renovated. At one point in the nineteenth or early twentieth century, the outer walls were redone with red brick. The real material changes and conversion from the old style Italian villa into the structure we see today began with Paul Rudolph moving into the house in 1958, exercising a common practice for the time, buying an old urban house, preserving the exterior and remodeling the interior. Rudolph was the chair of Yale University’s Department of Architecture and was known for his use of concrete and highly complex floor plans in the buildings he designed (6). Rudolph converted 31 High Street to retail space and apartments for rent and the top floor became the studio for his architecture firm and in 1960, he consolidated his architectural operations to New Haven, closing down other offices in Sarasota and Cambridge. (4). To the back of the house, Rudolph annexed a large basement living room and apartment for himself. The additions to the back of the house and conversion of the third floor to studio space used significant amounts of glass in order to take advantage of the natural light and view from the rear of the house. The large living room was meant to be able to entertain large parties. Rudolph passed away in 1997 but not before vacating the house, which led to it being converted into the completely residential space that it is today (5, 7).</p>','<p>Built in 1855, 31 High Street has always lied within the original nine squares of downtown New Haven. Its history of bouncing between commercial and residential use speaks to the nature of its urban context. In the last decades of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, New Haven grew into an industrial, transportation and education center, and with the expansion of Yale in the 1890s came commercial development along Chapel Street (8). During this time, High Street became a desirable place to live and do business, with people hoping to take advantage of this commercial development as families, doctors, and businesses moved in and out of 31 High Street during the late 19<sup>th</sup> century and early 20<sup>th</sup> century. Urban renewal and development in New Haven continued in the area throughout the 20<sup>th</sup> century, leading to 31 High Street’s persistence as a commercial and residential entity, with even Paul Rudolph renting out office space and apartments in the building. The house and its added complexity during the 20<sup>th</sup> century reflects Rudolph’s idea that modernism is also compatible with tradition (5).</p><p>Today, Chapel Street and other areas surrounding 31 High Street are still bustling with commercial real estate, particularly restaurants. This is largely due to Yale’s presence in downtown New Haven. The entire stretch of High Street is primarily occupied by Yale undergraduates, with numerous residential colleges and the freshman dorms on Old Campus in addition to various off-campus houses and apartment complexes south of Chapel Street. 31 High Street and the other residential properties on High Street between Chapel Street and Crown Street provide Yale students with off-campus housing with close proximity to campus and an abundance of dining and shopping options.</p>','<p>Prior to Rudolph, 31 High Street was a fairly standard Italian villa that bounced between residential and commercial use for about roughly a century. The house was home to different families, the office of a doctor and a funeral home, among other things (3). Rudolph purchasing the house and bringing with him his creative and unconventional design ideas altered the social capacity of the house greatly, even though he continued the mix of residential and commercial use. After it was converted from the mixed-use space to a six-family tenement, SigEp purchased the house in 2006 for $1,100,000 and it has been used as the fraternity’s Connecticut chapter’s house since (9). Today, the 31 High Street, along with High Street in general, plays a social role much larger than that of a house shared by its inhabitants. The SigEp house is neighbored by two other fraternities and the section of High Street between College and Crown is occupied primarily by Yale undergraduates. On any given weekend night, the block is humming with music from parties and other gatherings into the late hours of the night, largely due to the significant Greek life presence.</p><p>31 High Street in particular commonly hosts large parties for Yale undergraduates and the house has gone through significant changes to reflect its current use, which can be seen through the contrast shown in the pictures documenting the change in certain spaces over time. This conversion has been intentional and led by the national fraternity. In 2008, SigEp completed on a $25,000 renovation project to the house safer for the guests attending parties that the fraternity throws, like stabilizing and putting a guard rail on the stairs leading down to the large social space in the basement, along with reinforcing the balcony which at the time was close to collapsing (5). The once large, lavish personal living room for Paul Rudolph has been converted into a large party space used also for large gatherings of SigEp brothers, as the chapter consists of nearly 100 members. While the third floor was once an architecture studio, now is a living room and common space for brothers who live in the house and general fraternity members. The roof terrace has a rubber matting and guard rail surrounding it to make it hospitable to guests looking to enjoy the view out over New Haven. While it is solely a residential building, 31 High Street plays a much larger social role to Yale University and its students, as it frequently opens its doors to the Yale public, serving as a site of interaction between and recreation for students.</p>','<p>Before SigEp owned the house, 31 High Street was always a residential and commercial space, but in a more private function. Paul Rudolph and his architectural design additions changed the social capacity of the house, leading to its attractiveness to a fraternity looking to start a new chapter, which led to SigEp purchasing the house in 2006. According to the Sanborn maps, the house has always been located in an area focused on commercial activity and student life, due to its proximity to businesses, restaurants and government buildings in the downtown area, along with Yale College and undergraduate on-campus life since 1886 (10,11). The fact that its core function has not evolved incredibly over time can be seen in its appearance as well. The worn-down brick and grand Greek entrance show tribute to an older time and the house has kept its original structure, for the most part, since the 19<sup>th</sup> century.</p>','<p>1.

The building was designed and built by the architect Sidney Mason Stone starting in 1859 and modeled after the Ezekiel Trowbridge House (now the Center Church Parish House) also built by Stone in the mid-nineteenth century. The brown stuccoed, Italian Renaissance Revival style building is one of the few surviving examples of architect Sidney Mason Stone’s work. </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">It features a symmetrical and rectangular form; a flat, low hipped roof with </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">the cantilevered cornice lines</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">; an arched door with carved rope mouldings; a covered entry porch; and a tall structure.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Sometime after 1888, while owned by the Hotchkiss family, a large Tudor library was added to the house, carefully designed as to match the existing exterior.

The most recent renovations were in 2013. Clerestory Construction Consulting managed the 2013 renovations with Apicella + Bunton Architects LLC as the architects and Shawmut Construction as the general contractor. The renovations included new flooring, wall finishes, and lighting updates on the interior. A kitchenette, additional restrooms, and a catering servery were created by a reconfiguration of the first floor. The exterior renovations included restorations of the covered entry porch, window casings and trim, and the cantilevered cornice lines of the roof.

While most of the properties on Hillhouse Avenue and the neighboring streets are now owned by Yale University and used for academic purposes, the neighborhood maintains the character and integrity of the elite residential area it once was. The streets are lined with trees and mansions equal to the grandeur and scale of Horchow Hall. In a sense, it is a quiet oasis from the downtown and university campus just blocks away. Still, Horchow Hall and its neighboring buildings function as an integral part of Yale’s campus housing academic departments, institutes, classrooms, and laboratories. On any given day, hundreds of students and faculty can be seen walking about the area.</span></p>','<p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As many of the buildings on Hillhouse Avenue and in the Hillhouse Avenue Historic District, Horchow Hall was originally the residence for the elite of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Pelatiah Perit, a prominent New York merchant, had the house built in 1859 by architect Sidney Mason Stone. Perit lived in the house until his death in 1864 and his family continued to live there into the 1880s when it was bought by Henry L. Hotchkiss. (3) Hotchkiss and his family lived in the house until the 1930s. By this time, the house was a prominent building on Hillhouse Avenue.</span></p><p><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In 1932, Yale University bought the house from the Hotchkiss family. (4) Yale used the building for a variety of purposes including faulty residences, laboratory and office space for the Peabody Museum of Natural History, and offices for the School of Management. Yale actively expanding and bought property including most of the buildings in the Hillhouse Avenue Historic District. Like Horchow Hall, the properties were maintained and preserved but repurposed from their original residential functions to academic ones. Once the space for society’s established elite now became a part of the university campus.</span></p><p><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In 2013, Horchow Hall became the home for the Jackson Institute for Global Affairs, following a generous donation by John Jackson. The Jackson Institute continues to call Horchow its home today. </span></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In the pre-colonial era and prior to city’s growth and expansion, the Quinnipiac peoples lived on the land that would eventually become New Haven. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the site that would become home to Horchow Hall and beyond was owned by James Hillhouse, the namesake of Hillhouse Avenue. Hillhouse used his extensive property was largely used for farm land and later subdivided the land into the boulevard that would later take his name. When he came of age, his son, James A. Hillhouse, along with Ithiel Town and Alexander Jackson Davis would work to develop the area. With the construction of the Farmington Canal, commercial development increased and lot sales and home construction bloomed. By the mid-nineteenth century, Hillhouse Avenue became a prestigious residential neighborhood lined with mansions for the societal elite.

An extension of the modern architectural style of Morse and Ezra Stiles colleges, the building seamlessly blends into the identity of Yale, while striving to functionally serve the greater New Haven area. It is a focal point, attempting to connect Yale with its surroundings. A large glass storefront, outlined in a Yale blue, is angled towards the main flow of sidewalk traffic, inviting people to glance into its well-lit interior, and ultimately drawing them in as a natural ending point to a walk down the Broadway strip. Tenants (including the current one) have always featured a wide array of goods, mirroring the diverse functionality of the building itself i.e. residential quarters, commercial space, and a component of the Ezra Stiles’ courtyard. Its construction ultimately began the transition from small mom and pop stores into the well- known chains that line the street today, a change that is not only symbolic of Yale’s relationship with New Haven, but also one that continues to have ramifications up until present day.</p>','2 + B','200’ x 70’','<p>Original tenant: Yale Cooperative Corporation (Yale Co-op) (1962)</p><p>Current tenant: The Yale Bookstore (Barnes &amp; Noble College Bookstores, Inc.) (1997)&nbsp;</p>','<p>This modern, two story building has a 5-bay façade with a concrete, crushed granite aggregate exterior (1). The style is identical to Morse and Stiles, meant to resemble historic Italian villages of San Gimignano and Campo (2). Like the residential colleges, it lacks right angles. The original structure featured large, quadruple glass door entrances recessed under concrete canopies on both the north-end and south-end (1). In 1997, the interior was completely redone and the south-end entrance was moved as a covered awning was built between 77 and 65 Broadway after being acquired by Barnes &amp; Noble College Bookstores, Inc. (3). With this remodeling, a café and marketplace were added into and around the structure (3). In 2011, the arcade roof spanning over the walkway between the adjacent structure (now Apple store) was removed and the south-end entrance was moved to its current position (4). The interior has undergone further renovation, with the most recent one being the removal of the Starbucks café in the last two years (5). The south-end currently features a sleek glass façade and geometric entrance framed with deep blue metal. Colored shields protrude orthogonally above head, lit under recess lighting and protruding black lights. The north-end has a residential quarter and a one car garage appended as part of the neighboring residential college, and its entrance has been sealed off as a window. Four identical shop windows are recessed within the wall (facing Broadway) with rectangular cuts of masonry projecting out, from the tops of the windows to the roof line (1). The building has a flat roof with minimal metal ornamentation protruding right below the roof line (1).&nbsp;</p>','<p>The Yale Bookstore anchors the end of a commercialized Broadway “Main Street.” The consumer culture is baked into the landscape: from the parking lot situated on the middle island to the street’s sidewalk. Lined with alternating old lamp posts and Elm trees, the wideset, redbrick sidewalk is an idyllic escape. Depending on the season, vibrant flowers in woven baskets hang from lamp posts lights and decorative cabbage are arrayed in large ceramic pots that dot the street. The shops on Broadway, with their sleek, modern faces, combine with the surrounding landscape to make an overall aesthetically pleasing venue. The Yale Bookstore, situated at the half-point way on Broadway, physically marks the end of the string of retail shops and eateries (heading down from York Street). It is separated from the other commercial stores by a small pathway. The protruding colored shields work with the black metal shields on the adjacent building to create a strong sense of Yale as you walk through it towards the residential colleges. The Yale Bookstore, with its three heavily staged show windows, faces the parking lot, making it one of the first things you see when you get out of your car. The show windows and glass south-end entrance remind you of the retail aspect, while the concrete exterior and physical attachment to Stiles college keeps you grounded in the Yale sphere.&nbsp;</p>','<p>The building was designed in tangent with Morse and Stiles residential colleges. Since its creation, it has always been privately owned by Yale University and leased out to various tenants (1). Founded in 1885 by students and faculty, the Yale Co-op relocated to 77 Broadway, becoming the building’s first tenant in 1962 (6). The second co-op in the country, the Yale Co-op was the main source of merchandise that catered to the Yale population (6). Membership was only extended to Yale alumni, faculty, students, and employees, and it touted a “patronage refund” (6). Although the purpose and contents of the store adapted overtime, eventually becoming known as a sort of department store where students could find anything they needed in one place, the co-op still remained highly catered to the Yale population (5). When the lease expired in 1997, Yale filed a new lease with Barnes &amp; Noble College Bookstores, Inc. to manage The Yale Bookstore (3).&nbsp;</p><p>The Yale Bookstore opened with brand new renovations in 1997, featuring an upgraded space with "dark wood paneling, traditional furnishings, and a grand piano in the lobby," a Yale Marketplace that offered fresh produce, juice, and everyday essentials, an upscale gift shop, and a 75-seat Yale Café, all in addition to a larger and cheaper book selection and upgraded Yale merchandise labels (3). Unlike its predecessor, The Yale Bookstore agreed to extended hours and staying open later into the night. This change in tenants of the space did its job in attracting more retailers to Broadway, which is exactly what the University wanted, with its overall goal to "make the area more vibrant and lively and contribute to safety in that neighborhood and the economy of the city" (3). The introduction of The Yale Bookstore managed to bridge Yale and the surrounding New Haven community in the short run, but ultimately further insulated Yale with time as high-end retailers began flocking to Broadway to create the "Main Street" that we see today.</p><p>The Yale Bookstore today is no longer the leviathan complex it was in 1997, but it continues to command authority as the official site for campus merchandise and class supplies. It\'s the location where student-led tours end and where professors reference in syllabi for materials. However, a trip into the store reveals an interesting collection of random goods including a makeup counter, a magazine stand, aisles of candy and snacks, technology gadgets, dorm furniture, and a selection of rain boots, all in addition to the large supply of Yale merchandise and books, echoing back to its past function. The space is constantly adapting, and one can only wonder how it will change in the next few years as corporations like Amazon grow and technology shifts.&nbsp;</p>','<p>A dense cluster of small buildings was cleared to create the large building (7, 8). The corner of Broadway previously housed Boardman Manual Training School, the first technical high school in New Haven (9). The school was funded by donations from Lucy Boardman, “the greatest woman philanthropist in nineteen century Connecticut, if not America” (9). The land was owned publically by the state before it was sold to Yale in the late 1950s (9). Eventually the school and neighboring ones, Hillhouse and Commercial High School, were torn down to make way for the new residential colleges and the building that would house the Yale Co-op (9).&nbsp;</p>','<ol><li>Historic Resources Inventory—Buildings and Structures (Phase I), entry 46.&nbsp;</li><li>Stephens, Suzanne. “KieranTimberlake\'s renovation and expansion retains the medieval-modern spirit of the Eero Saarinen–designed complex at Yale.” <em>Architectural Record </em>11 (2011).&nbsp;</li><li>Dilger, Patrick. “<span style="color: rgb(0, 51, 102);">The Booking of New Haven </span>The Yale Co-op lost its Broadway lease to Barnes &amp; Noble last spring, but the venerable store is still in business, adding to the rich mix of&nbsp;New Haven’s publishing purveyors.” <em>Yale Alumni Magazine </em>(1997).</li><li>Yale News. “<span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Yale Bookstore being renovated.</span>” February 10, 2011.&nbsp;Accessed Feb 27, <span style="color: rgb(50, 50, 50);">2018. </span>https://news.yale.edu/2011/02/10/yale-bookstore-being-renovated</li><li><span style="color: rgb(50, 50, 50);">Mark. “Interview at The Yale Bookstore.” Interview by Sarah Oyadomari.

There is a white picketed fence that separates the house from the sidewalk. This feature exudes a sense of privacy that suggests the original residential purpose of the house. Behind the fence is the original house. After multiple restorations in the 20th century, the house is currently made out of the original wood structure (which one can still see on the balcony) and clapboards. Measuring at five bays wide and two bays deep, it has a 2 ½ story frame dwelling with a pitched roof (1). The original shingled roof was replaced by the current metal roof in the 1870s (2). The original house looks extremely organized and harmonious. The fenestration, for example, is symmetrically arranged. The door is situated at the center of the front side, framed by an entablature up on top and one pilaster on each side. During Victorian times, a two-story porch sits right above the door. However, it was taken down in a modern restoration (2). The chimney pierces through the roof of the building, adding grandeur to the entire structure while culminating the extremely idealistic desire within the symmetrical design. Inside the house, the wing scolding and the fireplace are still intact. However, there\'s no way of knowing how much of the interior is original.</p><p>	The east wing was later added on to the original structure. According to the comparison between two city maps from 1824 (Map of 1824) and 1879 (Map of 1879 by O.H. Bailey and J.C. Hazen), the West Wing was added in between those two years. It is a narrow 2-story brick house with a pitched roof (1) that is mostly concealed behind the original structure when viewed from the street. There are large rectangular double-hung windows, similar to the ones seen in the original house. The east wing was expanded in 1900 by Delano and Aldrich and again in 1963 by the office of Carleton Granberry, reaching farther into the back of the lot. (2)</p><p>	The west wing was added in 1900 by Delano and Aldrich. Like the east wing, it is also a two-story brick building with a pitched roof (1). It is, however, significantly wider, with a separate front entrance facing Elm street. The fenestration on this wing is of a different style. In addition to the standard rectangular windows, it also features arched windows and entrances. There is one chimney on each of the two wings, echoing the symmetric design of the front side. On the back side of the building, the structure features a very Federal look. It has a prominent pediment on top, as well as some Roman arches and a beautiful French door on the first floor.</p><p>	An appendage to the back (the rear addition) connects the east and west wing. This two-story structure was built in 1950 by Robert T. Coolidge (2). It is a brick structure with a gabled roof. The doorway on the back features an elaborate arch and two pilasters. The second floor features a porch with metal railing. The backside of the house, in general, forfeits the organized, simplistic look of the front, and embraces a more bourgeois façade with more intricate decoration and more complex spaces.</p><p>	The four parts of the building create a courtyard in the middle of the structure. It is a square space that connects the original house to the rear addition. The courtyard is decorated with Doric columns and pilasters and is surrounded by beautiful white walls. Everything about this courtyard is highly symmetrical, pristine and pure, showcasing the timelessness of such an idealist way of living.</p>','<p>	The John Pierpont House sits to the north of the New Haven Green, on the north side of Elm Street between College Street and Temple Street. Along with this short segment is a variety of architectural styles, from the federal style of the First United Methodist Church to the Venetian façade of Hendrie Hall. In between these elaborate architectures are three small white Georgian houses, one of which is the John Pierpont House. These houses possess neither the grandeur nor the complexity of the significant structures along the street. However, they contrast the bustling commerce all around the green, creating an enclave of "the simpler times." The highly organized and humble imagery of the John Pierpont House highlights the 18th-century urban morals of order, simplicity, and rectitude, upholding the values of the city from its earlier days.</p>','<p>	In 1766, Mr. John Pierpont, grandson to the beloved Rev. James Pierpont, married his wife, Sarah Beers. At that time, John had already been constructing his own house on the north side of Elm Street. Therefore, the newlyweds moved in soon after the house\'s completion in 1767 to start their new lives together. The Pierponts were a hospitable couple, constantly hosting gatherings of the Pierponts and the Beers (3). Due to the proximity of the house to the church, the couple also opened the home up as a resting place for all the Sunday churchgoers from distant counties, turning this private house into a community space.</p><p>	In 1779, during the revolutionary war, the British came into New Haven and pillaged the house, significantly damaging the furniture and portrait inside the residence. The British used the house as a Hospital and a station for the underground railroad. The house functioned almost like a headquarter of their operation until their eventual retreat from the city (4).</p><p>	John and Sarah had four daughters who were known for having strong individuality and for exemplifying the 19th century New Haven values (3). After the death of Sarah, the house was passed onto one of the four daughters, Miss Mary, who married Hon. Eleazar Foster in 1806. Because of this marriage, the house is sometimes referred to as John Pierpont - Eleazar Foster House (5). </p><p>	Mary and Eleazar had four children together, and they lived in the house after Mary\'s death in 1857. The last one of the four passed away in the house in 1900. That same year, Rev. Anson Phelps Stokes purchased the John Pierpont house. He commissioned large addition to the original structure to accommodate his visitors from all over the country. He was at that time the Secretary of Yale, which was the second in command of the university (6). Under his supervision, the first meeting of Yale missionary board took place in this house. Also, Yale in China was established in this house during this period (7). </p><p>	Yale University officially acquired this space in 1921 and began a thorough restoration in 1929. The University continued the tradition of the John Pierpont house as a social space, and established the faculty club, hosting dances and presentations for the professors. Along with the building immediately to its west, which serves as the Graduate club, the John Pierpont House became part of the campus that blends the rigor of the academia with the liveliness of the city (8). More additions to the building were built during this period to turn this house into a classy space for its esteemed academics.</p><p>	Later, the house served as the Office of Undergraduate Admissions before it attained its current primary position as the Visitor Center. Another restoration was completed in 2002 to equip this elegant Georgian building with modern infrastructure. Now, the John Pierpont House serves as both the Visitor Center in the front and the Henry Koerner Center for Emeritus Faculty in the back. This function of the house truly exemplifies the uniqueness of this space. The lavishly decorated backside provides an upscale social space for the University\'s most renowned faculty members. The front side of the building, the simplistic original structure, the emblem of New Haven and its rich human history, welcomes visitors from all over the world to Yale, and to New Haven.</p>','<p>	In the earliest documented map ever drawn on the city (Map of 1644), the land where the house currently stands on is ascribed to "Mr. Marshall." Although no such "Mr. Marshall" can be found in any historical material, considering that the map was drawn only six years after the founding of the city, we can safely assume that he was one of the early colonists in New Haven.</p><p>	On Sep. 25, 1685, the deed to a section of Mr. Marshall\'s land was given to Rev. James Pierpont as a ministerial settlement (3). The reverend stayed at a separate location, keeping the land vacant and passed it on to his son, who later passed it on to John Pierpont. John Pierpont constructed his own building on this ground, and this piece of land has stayed in the Pierpont family until 1900, when it was purchased by Rev. Anson Phelps Stokes (1). Yale University acquired the site in 1921 and the site has remained Yale\'s property ever since.</p>','<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Haven Historic Resources Inventory, Buildings and Structures Hist -6 New 5 77, (New Haven: The New Haven Preservation Trust, 1984), 2.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: black;">Elizabeth Mills Brown, </span><em style="color: black;">New Haven- a guide to architecture and urban design</em><span style="color: black;"> (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1976), 103.</span></p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Dana Collection</em>, 21 Elm Street (New Haven: New Haven Museum), 88.</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>“The John Pierpont House (1767)”</em>, Historic Buildings of Conneticut, Oct. 2<sup>nd</sup> 2008, <a href="http://historicbuildingsct.com/?p=1149" target="_blank">http://historicbuildingsct.com/?p=1149</a>.</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Dana Collection</em>, 21 Elm Street (New Haven: New Haven Museum), 90a.</p><p><span style="color: black;">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“</span><em style="color: black;">The Three Anson Phelps Stokes: Anglo-American Philanthropists</em><span style="color: black;">”, Chickenbones: A Journal, </span><a href="http://www.nathanielturner.com/ansonphelpsstokes.htm" target="_blank">http://www.nathanielturner.com/ansonphelpsstokes.htm</a><span style="color: black;">.</span></p><p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Haven Historic Resources Inventory, Buildings and Structures Hist -6 New 5 77, (New Haven: The New Haven Preservation Trust, 1984), 3.</p><p><span style="color: black;">8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elm Street and Yale University Building in 1919 (New Haven: New Haven Museum).</span></p>');

When facing them, 545 is seated furthest to the right. The row houses have a continuous mansard roof made of slate. Above the mansard roof, there is a decorated wooden cornice; a typical decoration of French Second Empire architecture. The windows on the first and second floor have ornately molded arched heads above them with shoulders coming down on either side of the window. The windows also have a four-over-four sash and molded sills to match the arched heads. The doors of each row house are not in the center, but sit to the left of each of the houses. The entry to each house has a heavy canopy that is held up by carved piers, decorated with ornately designed consoles. Each of the doors is double paneled. Unlike the other row houses, 545 has all black accents and ornamentation.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>*It is important to note, that out of the four row houses, 545 has been severely deteriorated. Much of the detail of this row house has been lost, including its cornices and slate roof. The porch and steps leading up to the entry of 545 have been replaced. However, the three other row houses remain mostly intact with the original cast iron railings and fences (see gallery for examples).&nbsp;</p>','<p>This set of row houses was built in an overall residential area. This building is in close proximity to a cafe and other small restaurants. 545 Orange Street is also near the Yale School of Management and Peabody Museum of Natural History. This set of row houses lies between Pearl and Clark Street. 545 Orange Street sits on the east side of Orange amongst other residential buildings. The buildings surrounding it are mostly of a variety of different mid-to-late 19th century styles, including Italianate, Queen Anne mode, and Gothic Revival. The buildings in this area are high in density and overall many in number. In the summer and spring months, foliage would surround much of the street and nearby houses creating shade and adding color to the block.&nbsp;</p>','<p>In the early 1800s, (Prior to the construction of this building), the land between State and Orange Street was a 112-acre farm belonging to a prominent city leader, Abraham Bishop (see image gallery (1)). Following his death in 1844, the land was subdivided and given to his heirs. Subsequently, in the 1850s, those heirs divided the land into building lots, which were then sold for profit. Streets in this area today remain named after his heirs (ie. Clark, Bishop, Nicoll. Edwards, and Foster).&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The sale of much of this land greatly attributed to the rapid development of the residential community in this district. This development was well-suited to accommodate the area’s rapid population growth. Although there was a significant amount of residential buildings in the area prior, the addition of these plots further contributed to the amount of residential development to the north. Many of the buildings designed in the French Second Empire Style are of the multi-family variety (like 545).&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>In the coming decades, the land continued to develop and became home to a mostly middle-class family population. Many of the people who lived in these houses were employed as skilled laborers, builders, shop owners, and businessmen.&nbsp;</p>','<p>545 Orange Street was originally commissioned by Mrs. Elizabeth Murphy. This row house was built around 1868-1869 by Nelson C Newgeon. That same year, he sold 545 to a clock maker named, Augustus D. Hendrick. Since its construction, this building has remained a residential establishment.&nbsp;</p>','<p>Google. <em>Google Maps. </em>http://maps.google.com&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Historic Buildings of Connecticut. <em>Orange St Row Houses, New Haven (1869)</em>. http://historicbuildingsct.com/?p=2756.</p><p><br></p><p>Hitchcock, Charlotte R. for the State of Connecticut. <em>Historic Resources Inventory: Orange St Area. 1982.&nbsp;</em></p><p><br></p><p>Mills Brown.

Its appearance provides no details about the building’s purpose; passersby may believe they are walking past an apartment complex, a school, or an office building. Indeed, the building’s indeterminate exterior effectively represents the mixed-use nature of its facilities. 305 Crown contains Yale Drama and Yale Repertory Theater faculty offices, a theater rehearsal room, the headquarters of two student-run publications (The Yale Herald and The New Journal), workspace for Yale’s LGBTQ+ community, and is the administrative home of The Episcopal Church at Yale. In this way, the structure helps maintain the welcoming environment Yale’s diverse base of students has found in this neighborhood.</span></p>','3','<p><strong style="color: windowtext;">1928-1973:</strong><span style="color: windowtext;"> The Yale Hope Mission (Christian mission, sheltered people in need of housing)</span></p><p><strong style="color: windowtext;">1973-1995:</strong><span style="color: windowtext;"> The Young Israel House at Yale (Kosher Kitchen)</span></p><p><strong style="color: windowtext;">1995-present:</strong><span style="color: windowtext;"> Mixed-use building for Yale, primarily Yale Drama/Repertory faculty offices</span></p>','<p><span style="color: windowtext;">305 Crown is a three-story Colonial Revival blonde brick apartment building (1). It is seven bays wide and features 41 windows of various sizes and shapes on its face. In typical Colonial Revival style, the rectangular structure boasts a symmetrical façade, bisected by a middle corridor of windows and an entryway that anticipates the central hallway of the building (2). A modest stone transom adorns the entrance as three columns of windows on both sides of the building extend from the street-level window wells to the roof. The first floor windows are the largest and sit within arched impressions in the brick. Both first and second floor windows are topped with subtle lintels made of brick and stone. Just below the roof is a simple stone molding that underscores a series of impressions in the brick that sit directly above the third-floor windows.</span></p>','<p>305 Crown is wedged between residential row houses and the Asian-American/Native/Latin American cultural houses of Yale University. Across the street is a residential parking garage for the tenants of nearby Crown Towers. 305 stands in an area known for its off-campus student housing and the Crown Street nightlife where food and drink favorites like Bar, Louis’ Lunch, and Geronimo’s entertain the city’s young adults. The building is further separated from its surroundings given the fact that most of the nearby buildings were constructed in the nineteenth century whereas 305 was built in 1928 (3). Due to the lively nature of the mixed commercial and residential surroundings, this building fades to the background amidst the hustle and bustle of the neighborhood and goes generally unnoticed by those who do not have specific business within its walls. </p>','<p><span style="color: windowtext;">In 1928, 305 Crown Street was built to accommodate the growing size of the Yale Hope Mission (4). The Yale Hope Mission was established some time between 1905-1909, during the undergraduate years of founding Yale student and Christian missionary William Whiting Borden (5). Born into a well-to-do Chicago family that made its fortune mining silver in Colorado, Borden made a name for himself at Yale by seeking to spread the word of God throughout the school’s entire population (6). He was highly successful in doing so, organizing various daily prayers and Scripture readings, and soon earned a reputation for steering even the most unlikely students towards the teachings of Christ (7). Soon, Borden realized the seaport city of New Haven attracted homeless people, alcoholics, prostitutes, and “every sordid sort of riff-raff” (8) that was in need of shelter and, in his eyes, guidance towards Christianity. He founded the Yale Hope Mission to take in those who were in need, and by 1930 the mission found its home at 305 Crown where it could accommodate far more people than when it was founded. Indeed, the building’s role as a Christian mission explains the scripture passages that can be found on the exterior of the building. On the far right corner of the face, its reads: “I am the way, the truth, and the life—John 14:6.” And on the east facing side of the exterior, the transom above the entrance reads: “Come Unto Me—Matt 11:28.” </span></p><p><span style="color: windowtext;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: windowtext;">Borden died young in 1913, but the Yale Hope Mission at 305 Crown marched ahead until the 1970s (9). In the 1970s, the building became known as the home of the Young Israel House at Yale. The Israel House served the Orthodox Jewish students of the university and was a welcoming space where the growing number of Jewish students could find community and solidarity (10). The space quickly became a staple of all Jewish life at Yale, which had only relinquished its quotas on Jewish student enrollment in the early 1960s (11). The student-run Israel House was informally known as the Kosher Kitchen because it was where the university’s Jewish students ate many of their meals from 1973-1995 (12). </span></p><p><span style="color: windowtext;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: windowtext;">The Young Israel House at Yale moved locations in 1995 (13), and 305 Crown Street again found itself in a transitory period. This was when the building started to become a mixed-use space for Yale, the role it still fulfills today. Presently, the building primarily functions as office space for faculty of the Yale Drama Department and the Yale Repertory Theater. The building also provides a rehearsal room for Yale’s theater students. In addition, the building houses the office for The Episcopal Church at Yale and offers study space for the school’s LGBTQ+ community.

Designed by Ithiel Town, one of New Haven’s most important architects, in the early 19<sup>th</sup> century, Trinity Church was one of the first Gothic Revival buildings in the United States.&nbsp;Just as its Episcopal parish constituted a departure from New Haven’s founding Puritan Congregationalist tradition, its architecture represented a departure from the norm at the time, and its design was influential in the design of many later churches around the country.&nbsp;Trinity remains an active center of spiritual life and community in the city of New Haven today.</p>','140\' x 69.5\'','2 floors plus a basement','<p>Trinity Church ongoing</p>','<p>This two-story <strong>masonry</strong> <strong>Gothic Revival</strong> church features a <strong>gable</strong> roof and a square tower in the center of the eastern façade, rising above the <strong>lancet arch</strong> entrance. The rough-faced stone blocks of the church are a deep red-brown color. The stone is locally quarried trap-rock diabase from Eli Whitney’s East Rock Quarry. (1) Ithiel Town described his choice of this material, “These natural faces present various shades of born and iron-rust; and when damp, especially, different shades appear very deep and rich; at the same time conveying to the mind an idea of durability and antiquity, which may be very suitably associated with this style of architecture.” (1)</p><p><br></p><p>The body of the tower features lancet arch openings, and the parapet has pinnacles at each corner and small crosses at the center of each side.&nbsp;The sides of the building feature lancet arches with <strong>stained glass</strong> windows.&nbsp;The upper part of the tower was originally made of wood, which was removed in 1870 and replaced with the current stone; the stone replacement also featured a short red pyramid topper, later removed in 1930. (2)</p><p><br></p><p>The rear of the building features an <strong>apse</strong>, added in 1884, also with a gable roof and a lancet arch opening in the back wall that includes five lancet windows and a small <strong>rose window</strong>. (4) The flat-roofed wings at the sides of the apse were added in 1965.

(4) The recessed chancel was added in 1884, and the carved white marble altar was placed in 1895. (4)</p><p><br></p><p>Trinity’s original windows were clear glass but have since been replaced with stained glass. (4) The current stained glass windows include four windows by the L.C. Tiffany Company (Tiffany &amp; Co.) installed in the late 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries, two windows by Philadelphia firm D’Ascenzo installed in the 1920s, a Grisaille window installed in 1871, and a window by Charles J.

(1) The formation of the parish challenged the established Puritan Congregationalist structure of New Haven, causing some controversy. (1) For this reason, the parish struggled to find someone willing to sell them land to build a church, so it was not until 1752 that the first Episcopal church in New Haven was built, a small wooden building on the southeast corner of modern Church and Chapel Street. (1)</p><p><br></p><p>The subject of building a new church to replace the old one first arose at a vestry meeting in 1810. (2) In December 1812, the parish applied to the town for permission to build on the Green. (3) The application was approved, likely an unimaginable occurrence for the original Congregationalist founders of New Haven who so resisted the establishment of an Episcopal church in their town. (3) The cornerstone of the newly constructed Trinity Church was laid on May 17, 1814, and the church was consecrated on February 21, 1816. (4)</p><p><br></p><p>For over 200 years, Trinity Church has served as a center of community life and spiritual activity in New Haven. (4) Trinity is known for its a strong sacred music program, centered on its choirs, and for its ministry to the homeless community through Chapel on the Green weekly outdoor services.

Sitting across the street from Wooster Square, it is difficult to imagine this building and specifically this façade was once intended to house a funeral parlor owned by the Lupoli family, which is what the gold engraved “Lupoli” above the entrance indicates. Starting out as a Greek Revival home for Henry L. Hotchkiss, the building was bought by the Lupolis in the late 1880s and transformed into a funeral home before going out of business and being internally remodeled to serve as residences. Now, it pays homage to these origins and its exterior with certain elements like curtains over the Depalma entrance doors and narrow stained-glass windows on this side of the building as well.</span></p>','unknown','multiple','multiple','Henry L.

"Lupoli to pay $110,000 overpoor practices." Elm City Express. June 20, 2008. Accessed March 1, 2018. https://elmcityexpress.blogspot.com/2008/06/lupoli-to-pay110000-overpoor-practices.html.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>','<p>	<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The history of Wooster Square actually began in the 1830s, which was around the time that this building was constructed as a house for Hotchkiss. He was one of many wealthy business owners who decided to settle in the area and made Wooster the appealing area it became at the time for architects. 576 Chapel was one of the important homes in creating the space and significance of Wooster because it, along with other expensive properties, presented an image that made other wealthy people want to invest money into the city.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">	The Wooster area did go through an economic and social slump in the 1930s, when HOLC maps put it in a red zone to discourage investors from putting money into the area and therefore further demeaning its reputation and hopes for help. It is unclear when this slump ended, but this may be the reason for the renovation of the exterior of the funeral home in 1935. Facing an economic and social decline, it would make sense for the Lupoli to assert their dominance and try to revive the market in the Wooster area by constructing the beautiful art deco façade.</span></p>','<p>	<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This building was constructed in the early 1840s as a Greek Revival home for Henry Lucas Hotchkiss, owner of a Rubber Company at the time. According to the Wooster Square Historic District, the Hotchkiss family was important in the area because they were among the earliest to settle in Wooster and had businesses tied to the city itself. The family was likely important in drawing capital to the city of New Haven and may have had a broader effect in this way. The 1911 Atlas of New Haven refers to the original owner of the 576 Chapel home, Hotchkiss, despite the fact that it had already been sold by this time. Although the building is three floors now, it was originally two stories and the third was not added until 1863. It is unclear when the Hotchkiss family moved out of the home or under what circumstances, but it is interesting to note that Russell Hotchkiss was involved with the New Haven Clock Company in the 1840s and this company very soon went on to be very successful in drawing European immigrants to work in New Haven. Interestingly enough, it was Italian immigrants that began to settle in Wooster in the 1900s and it was the Italian family Lupoli that eventually took over the 576 Chapel Hotchkiss home in the 1880s and remade the façade in the 1930s. In this way, the Hotchkiss family’s industrial ventures drew in the people who were to later inhabit and transform their home.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">	When the Lupoli family bought the home in the 1880s, they followed the trend of the earlier inhabitants by setting up businesses themselves. Starting off as a livery, the Lupoli business grew into a funeral home in the 1900s that ran until 2008. During the time of the Lupoli ownership, there was likely much importance placed in the funeral parlor because the façade renovation is intricate and indicative of grandeur. This business undoubtedly peaked in the 1930s with its exterior renovation. The Lupoli funeral parlor went out of business in 2008 after around a century of operation because several complaints were lodged against the owner for not providing adequate services or having the proper legal documentation.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">	After the Lupoli business left 576 Chapel, architect Christiaan Dinkeloo was hired by the city to rebuild the entire interior of the building to make it into condominiums. Although the interior was divided into eight separate homes, the architect did not modify the exterior at all and in fact took inspiration from the building itself in ornamenting the interior. Now, the building is more a part of daily life in the city as it houses families.</span></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">576 Chapel is located directly across the street from Wooster Square, near its southwest corner. It is located near other historic New Haven buildings and is actually right next to the famous Bristol House at 584 Chapel. A few doors down from it is a funeral home that is actually still in operation. This location nonetheless stands out from its surroundings because its art deco façade is so different from the rest of the older buildings with more traditional 1860s structures. In a sense, it is helpful that it is next to the Bristol House because this building also stands out in the historic Chapel Street setting and they almost emphasize each other’s non-belonging. 576 Chapel is definitely a building that sparks intrigue because it is so central and its façade facing Wooster demands attention. It also sparks intrigue in the visitor because it bears the Lupoli name permanently embedded in gold above its entrance.</span></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">1841~1860s: Henry Lucas Hotchkiss</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">1880-2008: Lupoli family, Lupoli Funeral Home</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">2008-now: residential, 8 tenants</span></p>','<p>	<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">576 Chapel was initially a Greek Revival style house built for Henry Hotchkiss. Although there was an added third floor during the Hotchkiss ownership, the exterior remained consistent. In the photographs of the building with its previous façade, one notes the contrast of the light-colored building and dark shutters on numerous windows. Although it has elements anchoring it as a very American building such as the coloring and the outward flaring of the roof, the height and strictly rectangular shape in addition to the use of column in the portico entries signal elements of Greek architecture. Also, the use of numerous windows piercing the façade allows generous light into the home in a manner reminiscent of those Greek columned temples.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">	In the modifications made by Lester Lulianelle that brought the exterior to its current Art Deco appearance, the building looks completely different. 576 Chapel is a true architectural palimpsest, with the visual similarities that remain between the original structure and the Lupoli façade being the very distinct and imposing presence of the heavy cubic shape of the building as it faces Wooster. In addition to that, the cement columns stylized in a two-dimensional manner into the brick surface of the building can be seen as both a nod to the original Greek Revival structure and an artistic element. The columns are interesting because they are not functional, but decorative. They add to the overall intimidating and impressive presence of the building. The columns make their presence known on the façade with their distinct color and materiality against the background of patterned brick. They are also wide and tall, bisecting windows and the building as a whole, and even ending beyond it with these vase-like figures resting on the roof. This new façade is also intimidating in its selective minimalism. Although the brick pattern and the designs on the columns and in the cement are intricate, there are only two large columns, and very few windows on the building as a whole. In the center of the front of the building, the centered octagonal window above the entrance fits into the whole geometric trend in the art deco style. This building makes great use of shapes and patterns on its exterior surface. The bold concrete outline around the front door of the building also gives it a look of great importance and is almost a visual reference to the mausoleum shape. It is interesting to note that within this concrete bordering, the Lupoli name remains engraved and painted in gold to this day.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">	One must also note the way the sidewalk and steps up to the building are designed to fit its style, extending its presence beyond the structure and into the sidewalk itself. In both the Wooster and the Depalma entrances, the railing leading up the steps to the building is also very geometric and has gold and black elements. They create more lines that resemble the geometricity of the art deco façade. This is also the case with the pavement leading up the steps to the Chapel street main entrance, where the initial large landing before the final steps has a diamond shape in the center and geometric lines on the sides incised into the cement.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">	The back of the building initially looks inconsistent with the rest of the building. Seen from the back, 576 Chapel becomes even more visually varied in its geometricity because the shape of the building is varied as if it were multiple blocks of different dimension stuck together to make one home, with the main façade cube being the most dominant. In the back of the building as seen from Depalma Ct., there is an entrance that is a long, horizontal rectangular prism likely made of molded concrete that has a pattern of squares on its surface. Although this initially seems inconsistent, it fits in with the emphasis on lines and rectangles used so much in the building. There is also a small echo of this pattern on the Depalma entrance, in the cement part of the building that breaks out of the top of the arch above the doorway and interrupts the brick pattern to end in a pediment shape framing this entrance.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">	In the interior modifications made within the last eight years to convert this building into a living space, there is once again an attempt from the architect to retain some sense of the exterior. We see homage paid to the building’s previous use in the way curtains are hung in front of the Depalma door, making this look like a funeral home still. There is also the preservation of the narrow stained-glass windows that are now part of a condo. In terms of the architecture itself, one can see in photos below of the interior of one of the apartments that the architect echoed the two-dimensional columns from the exterior and incorporated them into the condo walls. He also seems to have cut into the wall to create some sort of decoration.</span></p>','3','~75’ x 178’');

The brown stone exterior calls back to an Italianate style and though it appears simple, when examined up close, the archways and corner pieces are detailed with lines and insets. White window frames and red doors stand out in contrast to the brown building. The stone and window frames are weathered, attesting to this building’s long history.&nbsp;</p>','50\' x 125\'','<p>This three-story, Italian Renaissance revival church conveys a sense of majesty on the viewer. The strong lines of the building are accented by stonework around the corners and the windows that create a stronger contrast between the white panes. The stone building at once imposing and welcoming. The grandiosity of the architecture, including a circular inlet on the right front spire where a clock used to be, is softened by the weathering of the stones and though the accents sharpen the lines of the building, they also are delicate enough to convey a sense of intimacy to any given church goer.&nbsp;</p>','<p>The Church is set within a mixed residential and commercial area. There are multiple apartment buildings in the area with two occupying adjacent corners to the church. There are also some local businesses scattered around the area as well such as a dry cleaner and a funeral home. On a given cloudy morning, the area was quiet and the colors of the buildings popped, but being at the intersection of Chapel and Dwight streets, there was moderate traffic. The trees on the street were bare because of the winter, but one would expect that once spring comes, they will be lush and green, offering shade along the side of the church.&nbsp;</p>','<p>According to the Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps, between 1901 and 1924 an addition was built on the back of the building, which included spaces for Sunday School rooms and a gymnasium<sup>4,5</sup>. Furthermore, between this period, the height of the spires was reduced and the clock tower removed. The site changes ownership again in 1949 and by 1973, the owners had bought and demolished the houses around the back of the church to create space for parking<sup>6</sup>.The current parish acquired the church in 1976<sup>7</sup>.</p>','<p>In 1837, a congregation called the New Haven City Missionary Society was formed from the existing congregations of three other churches in the city. By 1870, noticing that the city was growing westward and in what appeared to be an effort to “cleanse” the Dwight area of vice<sup>8</sup>, the Society renamed itself Dwight Place Church (named for the block on which their new church would be built) and commissioned one of the foremost New Haven architects of his time, David R. Brown, to build them a new place of worship. The church was unique at the time of its construction because the materials used, essentially poured concrete shaped as stone, were an innovation. In 1949, Dwight Place Church merged with Plymouth Congregational Church to form Edgewood Congregational Church, which made its home in the Dwight Place Church’s building. Edgewood renovated the building, and removed the once iconic spires from the building in a 1952 renovation. After Edgewood merged with Center Church on the Green, the building stood vacant until 1976, when St. Paul’s, the current owner, took possession<sup>7</sup>. St. Paul’s Union American Methodist Episcopal Church is unique in that the U.A.M.E Church was the first church to be started in America and led exclusively by African-Americans<sup>1</sup>.</p>','<p>[1] Stannard, Ed.

This building is L-shaped in form with a tan limestone tower in the middle and radiating brick wings off to the sides. Although originally built to be the main clubhouse for the St. Elmo senior society in 1912-1913, the building was bought by Yale University in 1962. In 1983, with the donation of Richard N. Rosenfeld (B.A. 1963), the building was renovated and renamed Rosenfeld Hall. The building served as the Yale Language Lab, as well as, consisting of some dorm spaces for Yale College students until 1995 when Rosenfeld Hall became the official annex for Timothy Dwight College students as it still remains today.</p>','100\' x 125\'','5 (including Attic and Basement)','<p>1912-1962 St. Elmo Senior Society (Rhinelander Trust Association</p><p>1963-1994 Yale University Language Lab</p><p>1995-Present Yale University Timothy Dwight College Undergraduate Students</p>','<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rosenfeld Hall is shaped in an L form facing the corner of Grove and Temple Streets. The name Rosenfeld Hall is displayed directly on the left front wing of the building underneath a shield crest, while the left side just holds the shield crest. Hedges trim the Temple Street and Grove Street edges giving way to an open central pathway to the front door. Located on either side of the door and hedges are bike racks and benches.</p><p>The center of the building serves as the reflection point of the building as it is made of limestone compared to the brick sides. The tan limestone middle of the building resembles a short battle tower and distinct contrast from the rest of the building. The square tower consists of cross-shaped ornamentation above the Gothic arched entrance but below the second floor windows and the preceding turrets [6]. The top of the building accentuates the tower of a fortress image as it is lined with crenellated parapets and a shield topping the building [6].</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wings of the building are made entirely of brick although their limestone lining highlights the windows. Closest and farthest from the tower are three vertical-paneled windows attached in a row with two double vertical windows evenly located between. The windows on the first floor follow a similar pattern except the three-paneled windows sit two located on top of each other as the first floor is significantly taller than the three successive floors.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth floor, or the attic, is different from the two lower floors as more crenellated parapets, again evoking this battle tower ideal, separate it. The fourth floor is also gray limestone creating a contrast from the red brick of the wings and the tan limestone center. From the fourth floor, the roof starts taking shape in a typical gable form. Two chimneys sit atop each of the wings, for a total of four.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The street facing side of each wing, one looking towards Grove Street and the other Temple Street, consist of similar brick walls with limestone-trimmed windows. The only difference with these windows is that they protrude from the wall similar to a bay window style, instead of lying flat.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the inside of the building, a large foyer area awaits upon entrance with a small sitting room in front of you. To the right is a swipe access hallway consisting of three dorm rooms while to the left sits a large classroom. The second, third and fourth floor, accessible by stairs or an elevator in the middle of the building, consist solely of dorm rooms and bathrooms. The building itself has a basement, which contains a library, a laundry room, and a recycling and garbage room. On top of this though, there is a restricted sub-basement. This level, although currently used as storage space for miscellaneous items and for maintenance use as it holds access to the pipes, boiler room, and more, mainly consists of a large crypt that was previously used by the St. Elmo senior society. This crypt is where they would hold meetings and various activities and is comprised of a large square stone rectangle in the front of the room that sits on top an elevated surface and support beams decorated with skulls with wings meant for holding candles.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since its construction in 1912, Rosenfeld Hall has not been majorly renovated on its exterior although its inside has been slightly changed. It was only minorly changed to allow for the building to be used for the Yale Language Lab although it was then changed back to be used for entirely residential purposes.</p>','<p>	Rosenfeld Hall is located on the corner of Grove Street and Temple Street, adjacent from Timothy Dwight College, Silliman College, and Dow Hall (the current Center for Language Study). This area has a high building density but sits between Temple Street, which is mostly comprised of residential buildings, and Church Street/Whitney Avenue, which is mostly comprised of commercial buildings. Therefore, Rosenfeld Hall serves as the northeast edge of Yale’s downtown campus as everything eastward is part of New Haven’s business district and everything westward owned by Yale University. This location also sits at the foot of Yale’s Science Hill, as it is located on the street directly to the right of Hillhouse Avenue.</p><p>	This location is highly visible to cars and pedestrians as the entrance faces the corner of Temple and Grove Streets. Grove Street is one of New Haven’s busiest streets as it runs westward through all of Yale’s campus, so car traffic and noise is frequent. Being located between residential and commercial buildings, on top of being close to Yale’s campus, also provides Rosenfeld Hall with a lot of foot traffic.&nbsp;</p>','<p>	Originally named St. Elmo Hall, the building was constructed in 1912-1913 by St. Elmo, an independent entity within the nationally chartered Omicron Chapter of Delta Phi. St. Elmo was senior society that was comprised solely of the Sheffield Scientific School seniors who belonged to this fraternity [6].&nbsp;This new building became the society’s main clubhouse and residential housing for these students. In July of 1925 though, the Omicron Chapter of Delta Phi severed its ties with the national organization, thus making the St. Elmo senior society, an independent organization within the Sheffield Scientific School [5].</p><p>	As Yale College started to take over the Sheffield Scientific School and expand within New Haven, the institution looked to rent out space for dormitory space. In 1945, Yale University started to lease space from St. Elmo Hall, although now re-incorporated as the Rhinelander Trust Association. Then, in 1962, Yale University bought out the entire building from, now named, St. Elmo Incorporated, but with the promise that they would continue to lease part of the building for the use of the St. Elmo senior society [5]. This was short lived unfortunately as the University refused to renew St. Elmo’s lease in 1985, leaving the St. Elmo senior society to fund housing elsewhere [5].</p><p>	With full ownership and control of the building, Yale University renamed the building from St. Elmo Hall to Rosenfeld Hall in 1985 after the charitable donation by Richard N. Rosenfeld (Yale College B.A. 1963) to renovate the whole building [1 and 9]. With this donation, Yale University redesigned the ground floor to create a space for the Yale Language Library and Language Laboratory. The upper levels remained additional dormitory space to be used as an annex to Timothy Dwight College Students. Rosenfeld also endowed the future renovation for the entire Rosenfeld Hall building (including both the Language Lab and the dormitory space) with this donation [10].</p><p>	Rosenfeld Hall remained the Yale Language Lab until 1994 when it was converted to be totally used as dormitory space for Timothy Dwight College for the 1995 year. One large classroom still remained to be used for Yale College classes. It still currently remains as dorm rooms for any undergraduate students annexed from the main building of Timothy Dwight College. This body of students usually consists mainly of Timothy Dwight juniors, as well as, some sophomores.</p>','<p>St. Elmo, Delta Phi Fraternity’s house was originally located at 111 Grove Street and was built in 1895 [5]. Adjacent to this house, located on the corner of Grove and Temple Street at 109 Grove Street, was a residential brick house owned by Mrs. E.T. Denton [2]. St. Elmo acquired the lot of 109 Grove Street from Mrs. Denton prior to the construction of St. Elmo Hall in 1912-1913. The original clubhouse for St. Elmo was subsequently demolished to allow this building to sit on the combined properties of 109-111 Grove Street.</p>','<p><u>Sources</u></p><ol><li>2006 Yale Endowment Report</li><li><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: white;">Arnold G.

“the Modernist Neo-formalist style with its symmetrical white façade, rectangular form, and columnar supports whose clean vertical lines suggest references to classical prototypes" (1). Materials include precast concrete, asbestos siding, and insulated porcelain panels, with a flat, built up roof and glass and masonry walls. The walls on the ground floor are floor-to-ceiling glass, evenly divided by fourteen white columnar supports on the long sides of the building, creating thirteen bays, and seven white columnar supports on the short sides, creating six bays (1). These columnar supports, which are uniformly spaced and stretch the height of the structure, can be described as “Blakeslee ‘Bison System’ precast concrete tee beams used as exterior load-bearing columns in a unique application" (1). They even extend beyond the building’s flat roof in a “fin-like” manner (1).</p><p>	The north end of the building faces the Oak Street Connector, the west side faces Congress Avenue, the south end faces Lafayette Street, and lastly the east side faces Church Street South. Double door entrances are located in the centers of the east and west sides, facilitating the building’s symmetrical appearance. All the bays, besides those above the entrances, have vertical windows scaling most of the building’s height.</p><p>	There have been no alterations or additions to the building besides interior maintenance (1).</p>','<p>	The Doctors’ Building’s immediate surroundings include parking lots and medical and institutional buildings due to its proximity to Yale University’s medical complex, which consists of structures such as Yale-New Haven Hospital and Yale’s School of Medicine (1). The majority of these buildings were also constructed in the mid-1900s during the period of the Church Street redevelopment, but others are products of more recent architectural projects (1). The streetscape and general setting do give you a sense that the area has been redeveloped, with some regions thriving while other more bare and abandoned zones may not have benefited from the renewal.</p><p>	One of the most unique sites near the Doctors’ Building is the famous Knights of Columbus Building, which lies across the Oak Street Connector and was completed just six years after the construction of the Doctors’ Building. As you exit off Interstate 95 and enter New Haven, these two distinctive structures greet you from either side, introducing you to the architectural diversity that is characteristic of New Haven. </p><p>	In addition, the Doctors’ Building lies just south of the dense commercial district of downtown New Haven, so medical professionals and patients in the building are a short walk away from the bustling streets of New Haven.</p>','<p>	The structure for the Doctors’ Building of New Haven was only built in 1963, so the specific building hasn’t had any other tenants or owners. However, this region does have an interesting social history. As pictured in the 1888 Sanborn map and the 1911 Atlas of New Haven, the site of the Doctors’ Building used to be densely populated with smaller buildings and dominated by the produce market (2). On the topic of the Church Street South area of 1950’s New Haven, the city’s mayor Richard C. Lee said in 1965, “[t]he old market was a tangle of stress, often so congested that normal business was impossible. Most business was conducted from the tailgates of trucks. This was a truck market in every sense of the word, with little tax return to the City and few permanent jobs. The buildings that were used were obsolete and inefficient, relics of a bygone age. Streets were too often littered with refuse and filth and infested with rats and vermin. This was the sight that greeted visitors to New Haven as they left the railroad station. One can hardly imagine a less impressive entrance to a city" (2).</p><p>	As a result of the poor conditions of this area, the Church Street South redevelopment project emerged in the late 1950s and early 1960s with the Urban Renewal initiative. Mayor Lee wanted to send a message to Hartford that New Haven was the best city in Connecticut and represented the future of the state (3). In order to do so, changes had to be made. The region to be redeveloped consisted primarily of small stores, restaurants, theaters, and residences (4). Larger modern buildings like department stores, hotels, offices, a mall, and the New Haven Coliseum would take their place (4). The demolition and clearing of whole blocks allowed for more sizeable plans, like the Doctors’ Building, to be proposed.</p>','<p>	The initial proposal for the site on Church Street South was to build two tall apartment buildings (1). However, new plans to build the New Haven Medical-Dental Center at this site were approved by the New Haven Redevelopment Agency in 1960. Caproni Associates was the intended architect and Paul Weidlinger the intended consulting engineer of the 10-story project (5). Once again, this plan for the site was aborted, and “New Haven-based architectural and engineering firm Westcott and Mapes took over the project" (1). As a result, the Doctors’ Building of New Haven was constructed in 1963.</p>','<ol><li>Atlas of New Haven<span style="color: black;">. </span><span style="color: black; background-color: white;">1911.

Four large fire truck bays, windows, and a glass door puncture the red and let the insider view out. The building has a mostly square floor plan with the stark exception of the street-side curve that gives the station a quirky, streamline-moderne feel (1). In sans-serif, all-caps, black lettering reads “RESCUE • TRUCK CO. 4 • ENGINE CO. 6 • ENGINE CO. 3”. The last bit of the lettering peels off the building to force the viewer into viewing the sign as both ornament and structural. Its features are characteristic of architect Robert Venturi’s philosophy, a Philadelphian vanguard in the Postmodern movement. The fire station was completed in 1974 as the last of the urban renewal fire stations in the city (2). The building is still a working fire station.&nbsp;</p>','105’ x 110’ x 14’','1.5','<p>In  <em>Learning From Las Vegas, </em> Robert Venturi, Denise Scott Brown, and Steve Izenour lay out a distinction between two kinds of buildings, “the duck and the decorated shed” (3). The duck is a building whose structure’s function has been subsumed into a symbolic sculpture; whereas the decorated shed prioritizes accommodation and flexibility of function and uses surface level signage to express its function. The authors make an argument for the decorated shed over the duck because it is accommodating and allows its users to define their own functionality within the space instead of the building defining it for them. They set the decorated shed in opposition to the duckish brutalist buildings that define the space restrictively. We can see in the Dixwell Fire Station primarily a decorated shed but with some playful elements of the duck. </p><p>Architecturally, the most defining feature of the Dixwell Fire Station is the large, Franklin-Gothic-font text that wraps from the far-left edge of the building, just touches the four firetruck bays, and ends on a wall that breaks away from the rest of the building. The large block lettering is a testament to the “decorated-shed” style of Venturi’s architectural philosophy. The lettering is the decoration of the decorated shed, a vernacular sign like those of Las Vegas: fully expressive of the building’s function. The break-away wall draws additional attention to the importance of the text: it needs more space than the building has (4). The feature bears striking resemblance to a billboard or a poster peeling from the wall (5, 6). The sign leads the visitor from across the bays to the glass entrance open and waiting to invite the public inside. </p><p>Overall, the building looks quite ordinary, the simple shed  <em>Learning from Las Vegas </em> argues for. It “both fits into and stands out from its surroundings” (6). It is a fairly simple and personable building, made from red brick with a low broad stripe of yellow on the garage side. The yellow stripe gives “the low building the traditional bottom, mid-level and top” (7). The station takes on the tropes of an ordinary fire station, through the red brick and four large garage doors, but gives it a modern twist in its curved face. Like the other fire station Venturi and Rauch designed in Columbus, Indiana, the building’s simplicity “represents ordinariness symbolically and stylistically” (8). It becomes a symbol of itself. The Dixwell Station is probably a playful response to the brutalist Central Fire Station of New Haven, designed by Earl P. Carlin. Venturi et al. criticized the “Heroic and Original” architecture of the brutalist building, that seemed to threaten its surrounding and they argued instead for the “Ugly and Ordinary” (8). We can see the ordinariness of the building and its representation of the civic functions contained inside (9). </p><p>The building, in its centering of the “shed with a sign” retains one duckish aspect. Namely, the building itself recalls the very firetrucks within. The small windows just above the entrance evoke the windows of a fire truck, lifted far off the ground by the engine. The windows on the south side of the building look like a fire truck’s side windows. Additionally the red color evokes yet again the red of a fire truck. Even the signage, bisecting the building and indicating the fire companies within, resembles the labeling on a fire truck. The whole building features a “plain metal window trim” (10) around the windows and the top of the building. This metal trim again evokes the metal detailing on a fire truck. Altogether the building itself, like its signage, speaks to its function. </p><p>In older photos and plans, on the south side of the building there used to be six small white brick patches between the two layers of windows and six between the lower three windows and the ground (11). These patches are no longer visible except in the white mortar that must have been stained by their presence (see media gallery, South side of the building with weathered patches). In older photos, they somewhat resemble vents. Venturi Scott Brown and Associates say of the colored pattern, “the polychromatic brick pattern on the front enriches the facade and enhances its quasi-civic scale” (12). They appear to be another form of quirky ornament, perhaps to draw attention to the windows and the façade. </p><p>Just as the building wraps around the street, the cozy interior of the building wraps around the large apparatus room, a spacious bay for six firetrucks (12, 13, 14). The apparatus room extends to the second floor—giving the building only one floor in this area and two floors in the more human-oriented, fireman space (thus, 1.5 floors). On the first floor of the non-apparatus bay side, there is a lounge, kitchen, watch booth, training room, shower and storage, along with a space for mechanics. The second floor contains a large bunk room that fits twenty beds and extends for the majority of the space, along with more showers and four offices (14). Connecting the first and second floors are two staircases as well as a brass fire pole. The interior is first marked by a mosaic and is checkered with colorful yellow and red linoleum tile, which is ordinary yet fun.&nbsp;</p>','<p>The Dixwell neighborhood is dotted with red brick buildings  <span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">— </span>r<span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"> </span>esidences, churches, and commercial buildings. The fire station’s brick speaks to the language of the neighborhood, allowing it to blend in with its surroundings. As Vincent Scully once said of Venturi’s architecture, “his buildings were prepared to get along with the other buildings in the city” (15). Clearly this building speaks in the same tropes and materials as its neighborhood. The building </p><p>used to be in conversation with a brick church that stood facing it. However the church was torn down (16). The station matches the curvature of the street perfectly, given that the street was likely re-engineered around the construction of the fire station (I’ll address this later). The low building speaks to the sprawl of the city, as opposed to tall density. The large sign on the surface of the building communicates the building’s function to those driving past, just like a billboard on a highway (16). Indeed, Venturi thought deliberately about how to design for an “auto landscape,” and designed with communication to automobilists in mind (16). The pavement in front of the building opens up across the sidewalk and onto the street. Strategically, the buildings placement on the corner of three streets allows fire trucks leaving the building to travel in all four directions (17).&nbsp;</p>','<p>None</p>','<p>Beginning in 1961, the mostly-Black Dixwell area was the location of New Haven’s latest urban renewal projects (18). Urban renewal displaced about 1,100 homes and 200 businesses, and constructed 300 housing units as well as a half-dozen public buildings (19). In the beginning of the project, residents were mostly in favor of the services that the renewal would bring to the area. However, by the end of the 60s, residents mostly viewed renewal in negative terms due to the high rates of displacement (19). Protests against urban renewal were further powered by the Civil Rights and Black Power movements of the late 60s (19). </p><p>The Dixwell Fire Station was the last of the major public urban renewal projects in Dixwell (19). The Fire Station marks a shift and a bright-looking ending to the urban renewal project. Venturi and Rauch were critical of urban renewal efforts and believed that buildings needed to fit into their surroundings (20). While other renewal efforts used brutalist, foreign, concrete structures, the fire station is pointedly vernacular (21). It incorporates itself far more into the signs and commercial structures of the Dixwell neighborhood rather than the Gothic or Modernist Yale, just a ten minute walk away. Its colors and structure are a stark contrast to the earlier renewal projects and its sleek curve points a way further forward. </p><p>The building is still a working fire station, with a crew of 32 firemen and serves the residents of the Dixwell area. According to a pamphlet at the station, it received 6,800 calls from 2001-2002. It is also serves as a polling location (22).&nbsp;</p>','<p>The lot on the corner of Webster, Goffe and Sperry Streets has served variety of functions, though almost always it has contained one large lot, suitable for a fire station. Prior to the Dixwell Fire Station, the land was occupied by the Brockett and Tuttle Company, which manufactures carriages (23). This was followed by the Holcombe carriage company, which by 1924 was in the business of selling automobiles (24, 25). This shift speaks to the rise of the automobile in the Dixwell area from an early time. This history reinforces the way that the fire station’s sign interacts with the road. The area has always had a relationship to the transportation culture of the neighborhood. </p><p>However, the corner of these three streets did not even exist prior to the creation of the fire station. In the earliest maps of the a rea, Webster Street did not curve south to meet Sperry St. Even in the 1973 Sanborn map, when the lot was a parking lot, Webster Street lacked its elegant curvature (26). This curvature is distinctly important in its interaction with the building itself. The building is constructed so that it matches the curvature of the street, but the curvature of the street was clearly altered to match the curvature of the building. Thus the street and building form an even tighter partnership. </p><p>The area between Sperry and Webster Streets was occupied by residences, followed by an auto company sometime between 1924 and 1973 (27). After the fire station was built and Webster Street curved, a small traffic island was created where there used to be homes.&nbsp;</p>','<p>1. David B. Brownlee, David G. De Long and Kathryn B.

Liu, “The Creation of Urban Homes,” 50, n219.</p>','<p>The Beinecke was constructed by Yale to house its rare books and manuscripts. It has not housed any other institution since construction.</p>','<p>The Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library is a Modernist building located on the southwest corner of Yale’s Hewitt University Quadrangle, more commonly known as Beinecke Plaza. (1) A mechanical renovation was completed in September 2016. (2) The library is notable for the octagonal marble panels that make up its exterior as well as its distinctive boxy shape. The Beinecke’s Modernist aesthetic and cool color scheme contrast with the warmer colors and neo-Gothic and neoclassical architecture of the surrounding buildings. (3) At the center of the building, stacks of books lie within a glass shaft, allowing curators to control the humidity. (4) The partially translucent marble panels allow natural light through while protecting the books from the Sun’s direct rays. On a sunny day, the interior walls of the Beinecke seem to glow.</p>','6','208,476 sq. ft. gross area; 102,115 sq. ft. living area','<p>The marble panels lie between a grid composed of dark granite laid over a steel support structure. (5) Interestingly, the steel frame bears the same octagonal structure as the granite; the shape of the exterior is not simply cosmetic but actually imbedded within the structure of the building. (6) This feature is consistent with the architect’s “interest in using structural components as part of design.” (7) The main structure of the building is windowless in order to protect the rare books inside from direct sunlight, and the body of the building is elevated off the ground on four trapezoidal pyramid–shaped piers. There is a small space between the top of each pier and the body of the building, and the two are connected by smaller-diameter steel columns. The glass walls of the building’s ground floor are separate from its marble upper structure. The basement is home to offices for curators and other staff, reading rooms, and other research areas. Several of these offices are situated around an indented sculpture garden, visible from the plaza above. The garden holds three sculptures produced by Isamu Noguchi. (8)</p><p>Within the building, on the mezzanine level, there is little artificial lighting. The interior might even be described as dim. The glass-enclosed stacks at the center are themselves lit, making it easy to perceive the multicolored spines of the books. A series of glass display cases are placed around the circumference of this floor. The contents of most of these rotate regularly, but two exhibits are always on display: the Gutenberg Bible and Audubon’s&nbsp;<em>Birds of America</em>. (9)</p><p>A number of material and cosmetic considerations informed the appearance of the building. For example, the four piers on which the Beinecke sits are not structurally necessary, at least according to Gordon Bunshaft, the building’s architect. (10) Indeed, Bunshaft quipped, if the cosmetic concrete piers had not been added, the building would have looked like it had “‘toothpicks for legs.’” (11) The steel column visible between the top of each pier and the building itself actually extends far below. “‘It’s not a pin connection at all,’” explained the architect. (12)</p><p>More notably, the use of marble for the panels marks a divergence from Bunshaft’s original vision for the building. The architect planned to use Peruvian onyx. Each panel would have been composed of four separate pieces, and the seams between them would have been visible, as can be seen in images of Bunshaft’s model of the library. (13) However, he soon learned that the Peruvian quarry that he had planned to purchase the onyx from was unable to produce a sufficient number of sheets of the required size, and neither could any quarry in any of the countries he visited, among them Mexico, Tunisia, Italy, Egypt, and Algeria. (14) A number of possible alternatives proved unsuitable for one reason or another; marble from the quarry that had supplied the stone used in the Acropolis “‘looked characterless, like a lampshade,’ from the interior of a mock-up,” according to Bunshaft. (15) Eventually, it was decided that translucent marble from Vermont would be used. (16) The architect was unhappy with the choice; the substitute stone was “‘too strongly veined when you see sunlight coming through inside. It’s too yellow and black.’” (17) The marble has been indirectly criticized by others as well, as discussed below. The change from onyx to marble also meant that It was no longer necessary to stitch together the panels out of multiple pieces of stone. Because the marble was available in much larger sizes than the onyx, each panel could be composed of single sheet of stone. For this reason, the cross pattern visible in models of the Beinecke does not appear in the building itself, and this absence has led some to describe the panels as “blank television screens.” (18)</p>','<p>The Beinecke is situated on the southwest corner of the Beinecke Plaza. Also on the plaza are the Schwarzman Center—which comprises Commons, the Memorial Rotunda, and Woolsey Hall—Woodbridge Hall, and the Scroll and Key Tomb. To the south are Berkeley and Grace Hopper Colleges, William L. Harkness Hall, all situated on Cross Campus. The library is right at the center of Yale’s main campus; a line drawn from the Divinity School to the Medical School, a distance of nearly two miles, crosses right next to it. (19)</p><p>As noted above, the Beinecke’s style and cool color scheme contrast with the warmer colors and more traditional styles of the surrounding buildings. Bunshaft himself “admitted that the general tone of the plaza is more tan than white, and that the library is comparatively ‘cold on the outside.’” (20) However, this juxtaposition of colors is due at least in part to the necessity of substituting Vermont marble for the Peruvian onyx Bunshaft wanted to use. Ironically, the more local material set the Beinecke at odds with its immediate architectural environment. Moreover, the architect carefully considered how the building would stand relative to the other structures on the plaza. The top of the Beinecke is exactly level with the top of Commons, for example. (21)</p><p>Through modern eyes, though the Beinecke’s white and dark gray noticeably contrast with the reds, tans, and light grays of its vicinity, it is interesting to speculate that it is these very colors that rescue it from the fate of buildings like Ezra Stiles and Morse Colleges, which seem to be more a relic of the 1960s than an enduring fixture on campus. Indeed, the Beinecke would be entirely at home placed next to Yale’s CEID, or another such building.</p>','<p>While the Beinecke has been owned by Yale since its construction, the story of the building is its own fascinating social history.</p><p>In 1959, Yale University Librarian James T. Babb, who held the position from 1943 until his retirement in 1965, wrote to Provost Norman Buck with a set of concerns: The section of Sterling Memorial Library that housed the university’s rare book collection was “jammed full with no place to expand.” (22) Even worse, “The rooms are not air-conditioned and are too dry and overheated in winter and too humid in summer, which is very destructive to fragile and valuable books and manuscripts.” (23) A new rare book library was needed, one with enough space and the correct conditions to safeguard the university’s collections. Luckily, Babb had established relationships with a number of wealthy Yale alumni interested in rare books, among them the Beinecke family. (24) Dean of the Yale School of Architecture Paul Rudolph proposed a competition among four architects. (25) One of the four, Gordon Bunshaft, insisted that an architect must “learn about a building’s program from talking to the clients”; he believed that the proposed competition would not allow him to do so and that it would “inevitably [result] in compromised designs.” (26) Accordingly, he offered his services directly to the university provost, met with the Beineckes, and received the commission. (27)</p><p>The building Bunshaft created does, of course, serve its intended purpose—housing the university’s books and making them available to researchers—but interest from those outside the academic community has also influenced the way the building is administrated. The university at first planned to make the building accessible only to researchers during business hours. That policy was scrapped, however, when it was discovered that the building had broader appeal: it became something of a tourist destination for visitors to the city. The university decided to allow everyone, academically affiliated or not, to access the building seven days a week, and it has stayed that way since. (28)</p>','<p>At least until 1886, the lot where the Beinecke now sits seems to have been occupied by a unnamed private apartment building. (29) Between 1886 and 1901, however, that building was purchased by Yale to serve as a student apartment building and given a new moniker: the Highwall, apparently named for the intersection it sat on, is labeled as a student apartment building and a dormitory on the 1901 and 1924 Sanborn maps of New Haven, respectively. (30) The Highwall Annex, which bore the Beinecke’s exact address number, does not seem to have been constructed until after the university purchased the original building, as the annex does not appear until the 1901 map. A carpet cleaner, two storage facilities, and a private duplex also occupied the site around 1924.(31)</p><p>The incorporation of these properties into the campus was part of a larger process of acquisition by Yale of well-located buildings.(32)In the early 1930s, the university’s need for student housing would lead to the creation of the residential college system.</p>');

It is currently home to commercial shops on the first floor and various offices on the upper 3 floors. It is a Greek Revival as well as Colonial Revival / Federal style commercial building with clean and simple lines outlining the exterior, which is mostly brick and some stone/cement. Overall, the building is in very good physical condition and does not appear to be suffering from aging or deterioration of any kind. A series of shops have circulated through the first floor of the building, as it remains mostly for commercial means. The upper 3 floors have been mainly reserved for offices and business use.&nbsp;</p>','4','111.6 ft. x 106.77 ft.','<p>Various retail and offices (1832-2013), The Downes News Co. (1850-1891), Paul Denz (2013-2017), Sovereign Bank (?-2017), Annie E. Casey Foundation (foster care agency) (1976-2013), CVS Pharmacy (2017-present), New England Investment Partners (2017-present).</p>','<p>	This building employs Greek Revival as well as Colonial Revival and Federal styles. The Greek Revival is portrayed through the abstracted columns on the first level of the building. These are very simple columns that were implemented as ornamentation and do not bear any structural significance to the building. The space in between these columns is filled with larger single paned windows. The shape of the building is simple and rectangular with a flat corniced roof. The top 3 floors are made of red brick, whereas the first floor is white stone/cement. The double-hung windows are given slight accentuation by having white stone outlining their sills and headers. One good indicator of the building’s Colonial Revival/ Federal style is its entryway on the Church street side which can be seen in the figures below. The entrance to the building was initially positioned underneath 3 windows that are decorated with colonial revival ornamentation. This entrance has been relocated to the end of the building on the Chapel street side.</p><p>	The first level of this building has gone through a lot of change that we know of. Many different shops have cycled through residency on the first level. In one of the archival photos, it can be seen that the first floor may have once been a much more open space in a colonnade- esque format. This would make sense for its positioning across from the Green as the building could easily welcome people into its storefronts, thus interacting with the street more actively. Now this colonnade area has been shut off completely by large wooden/glass panels that enclose the large CVS Pharmacy within. One of the most interesting stylistic details is the cupola that juts out of the center of the roof. It is a large, white, cylindrical cupola with a domed copper top. The original cupola was removed to put a billboard at the top of the building, but this cupola was restored back to its original place in 1990. Renovations to the interior were done in 2003.&nbsp;</p>','<p>	The Exchange building is in the midst of New Haven’s financial and commercial district. It was initially the first building meant solely for commercial use in New Haven. Its position on the corner of Chapel and Church street puts it in the center of downtown, a hustling and bustling area of the city often congested with traffic on both the street and sidewalk. Directly across the street is the New Haven Green, a highly functioning civic space in the city. Its location across from the Green would have welcomed many people into the commercial first floor of the building, which as said before was once more open with many different storefronts. </p><p>	Though the exchange building itself has not changed much since it was built, aside from the smaller renovations, the surrounding area has changed a lot, as can be seen through the Sanborn Maps. Initially, in 1886, this block of Church street contained a church and a hotel along with the shops that lined the first floor of the Exchange Building. By 1901, the hotel remained, but the church had been converted to a public library. By 1973, both the hotel and church had been demolished to accommodate the Second National Bank Building and United States Post Office and Court House. Overall, this area of the city has always been highly interactive with the public, and the Exchange Building was the heart of the early commercial activity in this part of town. In present day, It is surrounded by other commercial buildings as well in the forms of retail and food shops. Directly across the street from the Exchange building today is a clothing store and a Starbucks Coffee among many other forms of retail in the area including Blue Nile Jewelry, Taste of Brazil Restaurant, and Dollar Tree convenience store.&nbsp;</p>','<p>	The Exchange Building has a long commercial History, a lot of which is not precisely documented. Since it was a commercial building, there were many switches in ownership over its large history. From the early time of this building, photographs show the commercial state of the first level of the building in 1933. It can be speculated from these photographs attached below what businesses occupied the first floor of the building. It is clear that there was once a Metro Mart on the corner of the first floor, a shop called Merle’s Record Rack on the Church street side as well as fashion store next door. On the Church street side of the building Ned’s Stand, a Newspaper, magazine and book shop, and Unique Boutique both occupied storefronts. Overall, this shows the pattern that the first floor of this building was always used for commercial means. It is also speculated from the photographs that the upper levels of the building remained offices as they were meant to be from the building’s construction. </p><p>	A well known company that occupied a storefront in the Exchange Building from 1850-1891 was The Downes News Co. This shop was known as New Haven’s first news dealer and it sold New York papers to the public. More recently, the Annie E. Casey Foundation, a foster care agency, occupied the top 3 floors of the building from 1976-2013. After shutting down their operations in 2013, developer Paul Denz purchased the building immediately and leased the office space. During this transition the first floor remained as a Sovereign Bank. In 2017, however, the building went on the market again. Denz ended up selling the building to New England Investment Partners for three times the amount he bought it for. New England investment partners then leased the top three floors to the current tenant, Square 9 Softworks. 2017 also marked the transition from Sovereign Bank to CVS Pharmacy on the first floor. </p><p>	These constant switches in ownership show us a few different things about the Exchange Building. Firstly, it shows us that this is a highly desired spot in the city. Its location in downtown brings in a lot of business which is why it is the heart of the commercial district. Secondly, It reveals a pattern in land use that this building portrays. Through this history, it is very clear that the first floor was always used commercially and the upper floors were offices and non-retail businesses. This same pattern is true for many tall buildings that we see today.&nbsp;</p>','<p>	There is not much known about the site before the Exchange Building occupied it aside from a few very old maps accessed through the Gathering a building project. One of the oldest maps of the original 9 squares from 1748 of New Haven depicts the corner of Chapel and Church street as the home of a man named Israel Smith. In another map from 1824, it appears that this corner was still residential. Finally, the Exchange building was built in 1832 as an effort to create a commercial district in the downtown of the city. The building has remained in this spot ever since.&nbsp;</p>','<p>"123 Church St." Vision Government Solutions.

Previously on this site stood two Queen Anne style three-family tenements demolished in 2003 due to asbestos contamination (2, 3).

Like other 21st century modern houses, the multiple box shaped structures have several wall textures -- in this case the clapboard siding, glass windows, and the plaster wall, each on different planes providing a visual 3-dimensionality. The unifying material is the decorative red clapboard, which encases the house like “gift wrapping.” Also typical of the 21st century modern style is the horizontal railing on the small porch in the center of the facade and the horizontally oriented floor to ceiling windows flush with the surface of the building (10). </p><p><br></p><p>The building features a small external play area as well as a parking lot that can accommodate six cars. </p><p><br></p><p>It shares some features with international style buildings, particularly the cantilevered projection above the entrance supported by unelaborated square columns. The advent of the international style was concurrent with technological advances which meant that walls no longer had to be load-bearing. As a result, walls were used much more decoratively and such cantilevered projections emphasized their non-supportive nature. However, unlike the decoupage of the Alvis Booker building, the international style is often characterized by a singular exterior material, typically white stucco (11).&nbsp;</p>','<p>The Dwight neighborhood has historically been predominantly residential, adjacent to but distinct from the commercial center of Downtown New Haven (12). The Alvis Booker building is on Edgewood Avenue, the “main street” of the neighborhood which experiences a fair amount of bicycle, pedestrian, and motor traffic. Also on Edgewood Avenue are the Troupe School, Amistad Academy (formerly the Timothy Dwight School), several other early childhood education centers, and Yale University causing some to deem it the “Educational Corridor” of the neighborhood (13). 230 Edgewood Avenue is also near Yale New Haven Hospital. Speaking to its roots as a working class industrial neighborhood, vernacular forms of Federal style, Greek Revival, Second Empire, Queen Anne, and Colonial Revival houses are extremely prevalent in the Dwight Neighborhood (13). In addition to these single and multi-family homes there are also small apartment buildings as well as large apartment blocks. Some of these residential buildings are in excellent condition, yet others are vacant or in disrepair. The modern school building at 230 Edgewood stands out amongst the much older residences around it due to its style and material--particularly the bright red clapboard that wraps around the building.&nbsp;</p>','<p>The Dwight neighborhood evolved as a working class residential area in 19th century New Haven due to the expansion of the carriage industry and other light manufacturing enterprises. The properties were bought by carriage and construction workers who wanted to live near their jobs (which is reflected in the above sampling of tenants from city directories in various years) as well as speculators. The neighborhood is adjacent to Yale University’s campus and Downtown New Haven; as a result there are small enclaves of wealth such as Linwood Avenue (13). </p><p><br></p><p>However, in 1937, the neighborhood was yellow-lined in the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation’s “Residential Security Map of New Haven” created by Homer Hoyt, which evaluated neighborhoods for investment risk and was heavily skewed on the basis of class and race. The result of these designations was a depression of land values which contributed to post-war urban decline (14). </p><p><br></p><p>The largely working class neighborhood became significantly poorer after WWII when wealthier residents fled the district and many buildings were converted for multi-residential use. Much before than this trend, the buildings at 228 and 230 had historically been two-family houses, but as early as 1895 were used to house three families each (2). In the 1960s the Black population of the Dwight Neighborhood rose from 7% to 20%, which was viewed as an expansion of the Hill neighborhood. In spite of this influx of people, deterioration of buildings and commercialization drove people to suburbs or other urban areas, which lead to a 35% decrease of population between 1940 and 1970. While there have been some efforts to “improve” the neighborhood such as the construction of the 1964 Timothy Dwight School or clearing land for large housing projects, much of the area had fallen into disrepair (12). </p><p><br></p><p>In the 1990s, high crime rates in the nearby Dwight neighborhood reportedly affected the choices of potential Yale applicants, causing the University to intervene (15). In 1995 the Greater Dwight Development Corporation was founded by members of the Yale Law School, and it subsequently implemented a series of development initiatives that continue to this day (13). The corporation helped secure funding for an additional gymnasium at the charter school Amistad Academy, formerly the Timothy Dwight School. It has also been involved in renovation for houses across the neighborhood as well as support for owner-occupants. The Greater Dwight Development company brought the large and affordable Shaw’s grocery store to Whalley Avenue, and after it left a Stop and Shop in its place, preventing the neighborhood from becoming a “food desert” (16). All of these measures are part of the Dwight Neighborhood Plan, which the corporation helped to devise; the four main thoroughfares of the area (Whalley, Edgewood, Chapel, and the Route 34 connector) are to be transformed into the “commercial corridor,” the “education corridor,” the “arts and business corridor” and the “green mixed-use corridor” respectively (17). </p><p><br></p><p>Another one of the Greater Dwight Development Corporations initiatives is the construction and operation of the Montessori School on Edgewood at 230 Edgewood Ave., housed in the same building as their offices. It is an early childhood care center that offers year round classrooms for children 18 months to 3 years old from 7:30 to 5:30 using the Montessori educational pedagogy (18). The basement is a play area for older children, the first floor houses three infant to toddler classrooms, the second floor is used for preschool classrooms, and the third flood is the cite of </p><p>the GDDC offices (18). Tuition for the Montessori School on Edgewood is determined by a sliding scale (19). </p><p><br></p><p>While access to early childcare, affordable food, and improved housing opportunities is a boon for residents of the Dwight neighborhood, director of the Greater Dwight Development Corporation Linda Townsend Maier is transparent about the motivation for these projects: </p><p>"In the mid-90s, there was so much crime in the city and this section of town that it started to affect students\' desire to come to Yale. So Yale decided to work with our neighborhood and we applied for federal funding that was offered to universities that partner with urban areas to address crime and help change the dynamics of the community" (15). </p><p><br></p><p>It is unclear if these measures to create a buffer space between Yale students and the city around them will lead to price increases that could force residents out of the area. The consequences of measures taken by the Greater Dwight Development Corporation are still unfolding and will continue to impact the neighborhood and the lives of its residents.&nbsp;</p>','<p>The Alvis Booker building stands on lot 228 and 230 on Edgewood Avenue, where two three-family tenements stood until 2003 (3). In 1886, the Sanborn map shows an unnumbered lot that would eventually be split into 228 and 230 Edgewood Avenue (at that point named Martin street) (20). The Historic Resources Inventory estimates that both houses were built around 1890 (2). The 1901 Sanborn maps shows that the lots had been separated (though the 230 lot was then connected to another lot to its left on Beers st.); both two-story dwellings with wood roofs and wood shingling have been constructed on 228 and 230 Edgewood Ave (21). In 1973, both buildings are still standing, and each lot has an outbuilding as well as the primary structure (22). According to the 1979 Historic Resources Inventory, both houses were Queen Anne style with brick foundations, wood frames, gabled roofs, and asphalt shingles, and the outbuildings on both lots are garages (2). However, the building on the 230 lot has aluminum siding, while the one on the 228 lot notably has asbestos siding (2). Over the years between their construction and demolition these three-family tenements housed many people, some of whom are listed above; some of them unsurprisingly worked in carriage factories as well as in construction both of which were highly represented populations in the Dwight neighborhood (12). </p><p><br></p><p>In 1980, Brenda Jones, the owner of the house on 230 Edgewood, applied to repair the house. Her efforts included removing and relocating interior non bear partitions, installing new kitchen cabinets, installing underlayment for floors, general cosmetic repairs and painting (23). </p><p><br></p><p>In 1982, Richard McNamara applied to repair walls and ceiling throughout, rebuild front porch, repair broken windows, tile in kitchen and bathrooms at 228 Edgewood Ave (24). Subsequently, in 1996 owner of 228 Edgewood Ralph Morotolli applied to repair fire damage (mostly on the first floor), apply fire code mandated sheetrock, install new windows, and provide smoke detectors to each room (25). </p><p><br></p><p>In 1995 Brenda Jones received a demolition order on her house due to the presence of asbestos (3). The Greater Dwight Development Corporation acquired the lot for $0 in 1999 and still owns it today (9). It is not until 2003 that both 228 and 230 Edgewood Ave. would be demolished (3). </p><p><br></p><p>In 2006 the Alvis Booker building was erected to house the Montessori School on Edgewood as well as the offices of the Greater Dwight Development Corporation (13).&nbsp;</p>','<p>(1)&nbsp;Yale Urban Design Workshop.  <em>Dwight Neighborhood Planning Update 2007</em> .

Victorian, Italianate Style. Constructed around 1885, the building has a flat roof with wide overhanging cornice. The double-bowed front façade is brick with sandstone lintels and sills on the windows. The windows along the two sides and back of the building have brick jack arches. The symmetry and flat lintels are reminiscent of the Federal Style popular in late 18</span><sup style="color: black;">th</sup><span style="color: black;"> and early 19</span><sup style="color: black;">th</sup><span style="color: black;"> century architecture. All of this, including the presence of a wood-framed front porch are part of the original design. The building is approximately 9,712 square feet and sits on a lot that is approximately 40’x60.’</span></p><p>	<span style="color: black;">There have been a few notable additions and alterations to the building. In the front, the two doors are new as is the bay window on the first floor of the left projection. A flat-roofed porch has been added that extends from the center of the right projection around the left corner of the building. The right side of the building has retained its original brick while the left side of the first floor has been covered with a stone tiling and the porch and stairs have been updated with dark granite. These updates were also accompanied by a new railing that lines the porch at 140 Howe St. In the back of the building, the first and second floors of the building appear to have been extended back with the addition of a wood-framed annex. </span></p><p><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first floors of each unit houses separate commercial restaurants while the other two floors are apartments. The building is situated on the left side of the one-way street, flanked by a wide driveway and a residential building on to the South, a house that has been converted into a Mexican restaurant to the North, and a Marriott Hotel to the West. </span></p><p><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>','<p>	<span style="color: black;">The building located at140-142 Howe Street is estimated to have been built in 1885. The Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps indicate that the original structure, with its brick exterior and wood-frame porch, have remained consistent for more than a century of New Haven’s history. What have changed, however, are the surrounding buildings. This block of Howe Street used to be primarily residential but many of its buildings have since been converted to commercial structures. 140-142 Howe Street itself seems to have been converted from primarily flats, to a split residential/commercial structure with two restaurants occupying each side of its first floor since the mid 1900s. </span></p><p>	<span style="color: black;">Today, the split-purpose building provides a transition between the more commercial Whalley Ave and Broadway Shopping areas and the more residential section of central Howe Street.</span></p>','<p>	<span style="color: black;">Although the original owner(s) of the building are unknown, its structure and residential purpose have remained constant since its construction in 1885. The Sanborn Maps of 1886 suggests that the building has always been divided and that it served as an apartment building as early as 1930, if not before. The New Haven Online Assessment Database approximates that the Lee family purchased the property at 142 Howe St in 1985 and that at 140 Howe St in 1991. After immigrating to the U.S. from China, the Lee family opened and operated The New China Restaurant Until 2017. At this time, ownership of 140 Howe St changed from the Lee Family to 140 Howe Street LLC. The location has since seen a number of Asian restaurants including Royal India and Kamal Indian Cuisine. Today 140 Howe St hosts Hasna’s Grill, and at 142 Howe St sits Basil Restaurant. </span></p><p>	<span style="color: black;">The location has also seen a number of renters in its second and third floor apartments. The New Haven Directories have document residents of 140 and 142 Howe St since 1916, however ownership was not properly documented until the tax assessor’s records identified the Lee family as having purchased both units. </span></p><p>	<span style="color: black;">The identity that 140-142 Howe Street has adopted as the location of restaurants serving ethnic cuisine evidences the city’s evolution from its puritanical, New England origins to what is now a diverse and modernized urban space.&nbsp;</span></p>','<p>	<span style="color: black;">The lot at 140-142 Howe Street has remained been relatively consistent over the years. A map of New Haven published by Collins and Clark in 1851 shows that that block of Howe Street was largely undeveloped at the time, despite a few small structures. The roads that outline the block however are in the same locations as they are today. The Sanborn Fire Maps show indicate that the block was slowly developed an that the structure that sits at this address today was the first to be built on this lot. </span></p><p><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;140-142 Howe Street sits on the far end of the street, just before it runs into Whalley Avenue. Whalley Ave. is one of the main roads that radiate off from the original nine squares of downtown New Haven and connects the city to neighboring towns. Whalley juts off to the Northwest towards West Haven.

Its façade is made of stone, while the majority of the building is comprised of a combination of brick and stone details. Behind the façade, in the center of the building, a tall windowless rectangular tower rises up imposingly. This tower, which has no rooms inside, has no functional purpose and is kept locked. The building contains a proscenium theatre that can seat 654 people on the ground floor and in the balcony. Additionally, within the building are located a box office, scenery shop, and rooms for props and costumes. The University Theatre has been used for productions by the Yale School of Drama, the Yale Dramatic Association, and the Yale Repertory Theatre, and its construction in 1926 helped provide a sense of legitimacy and importance for the theatrical arts at Yale.&nbsp;</p>','95\' x 171\'','3','<p>This large, three-story theatre has an ornate façade, made of limestone and seam-faced granite ashlar, resembling that of a Gothic cathedral. This current façade is James Gamble Rogers’ 1931 renovation of the original: a replacement designed to liven up the external appearance of the theatre. At the corners of the façade, the gray stone blends into red brick, which comprises the rest of the building. The roof of the theatre is flat, while on its south side a shingled gable roof slants down over the brick projection that runs alongside the central building. Rising up from the flat roof of the theatre stands the central rectangular brick tower, which is windowless and adorned with stone detail to evoke a Gothic arch design. On top of the tower, on the front left corner as seen from the street, sits an octagonal stone turret. If the façade resembles a Gothic cathedral, the tower resembles a medieval castle, conveying power without demanding attention. </p><p>The Collegiate Gothic elements of the University Theatre echo the similar styles of other Yale buildings, most of which were also designed by Rogers. Most notably, comparisons can be drawn between the University Theatre and Sterling Memorial Library, Payne Whitney Gymnasium, and Harkness Tower, along with the rest of the Memorial Quadrangle. </p><p>The front doors of the theatre open up to a lobby that contains the box office. Beyond the lobby sits the theatre itself, whose red carpet divides the rows of red cushioned seats. Above the first floor a balcony overlooks the wooden stage, which is flanked by two concrete walls. The third floor of the theatre was not added until 1957 by Henry F. Miller. It originally held the Drama School Library, but this has since been relocated to the Robert B. Haas Family Arts Library. Overall, the University Theatre stands as an impressive monument to the theatrical arts at Yale, with its powerful structure and church-like façade demanding that theater be recognized and venerated.&nbsp;</p>','<p>The Yale University Theatre, located in Downtown New Haven, sits on York Street in the middle of Yale’s campus. It is flanked by Davenport College and Pierson College, and </p><p>faces Jonathan Edwards and Saybrook, which both share aspects of the theatre’s architectural style. Nearby are many other Yale buildings: the School of Architecture, the Wolf’s Head society building, the Art Gallery, and the Afro American Cultural Center, as well as a number of administrative offices housed in buildings that were once occupied by fraternities and societies. Additionally, the University Theatre sits between the Broadway and Chapel shopping districts. In its location, the University Theatre stands as an impressive monument at the end of Library Walk, by which it is connected to Old Campus.&nbsp;</p>','<p>In 1924, Edward S. Harkness donated over $1 million to establish a drama department within the Yale School of Fine Arts and pay for the construction of the University Theatre, where the department could be housed. Harkness’ decision to fund a drama department was in part inspired by the Yale Dramatic Association, an undergraduate organization that had been putting on shows since 1901. The theatre itself was designed by Blackall, Clapp, &amp; Whittemore, and constructed from 1925 to 1926. In 1955, the Yale School of Drama became a professional school independent from the umbrella organization of the School of Fine Arts. Then, in 1966, the dean of the School of Drama, Robert Brustein, established the Yale Repertory Theatre. While the Repertory Theatre has its own official space in a repurposed church on Chapel Street, the University Theatre continues to be used jointly between the School of Drama, the Dramatic Association, and the Repertory Theatre, thereby acting as a unifying space for the dramatic groups at Yale.&nbsp;</p>','<p>According to Sanborn maps from 1886, 1901, and 1924, prior to 1925 the site of the University Theatre was used as a private residence. Then in 1925, construction began on the University Theatre, which was subsequently finished in 1926 by Blackall, Clapp, &amp; Whittemore. In 1931, James Gamble Rogers renovated the façade to eliminate some of the theatre’s “original severity”. A third floor was added to the building in 1957, designed by Henry F. Miller, that originally housed the School of Drama’s Library. In the late 1960s, the theatre was still thought by students to be overly formal and stuffy, so Daniel Scully and Robert Knight designed a marquee from metal pipes, car headlights, and oil drums to grace the front of the building. However, this marquee was removed twenty years later. Since then, the theatre has been used for countless performances, and remains crucial to Yale’s dramatic organizations.&nbsp;</p>','<ol><li>The Buildings of Yale University, Bulletin of Yale University, Series 61, Number 3, 1965, 35. </li><li>Brooks Mather Kelley, <em>Yale: A History</em>, (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1999), 384. </li><li>Report of the Treasurer of Yale University, Bulletin of Yale University, Series 18, Number 23, 1922, 23-24. </li><li>“Facilities,” Yale School of Drama, accessed February 20, 2018, https://drama.yale.edu/facilities. </li><li>Robert A.

Due to the high water table of the site, Roche experimented with parking options until he settled on placing the parking garage on top of the actual arena structure. It was meant to allow easy pedestrian access to the retail that was originally planned for ground level.

From street-view, one can see the façade of the residential home and the storefront of the Moroccan Restaurant through a small passageway. The residential home extends outwards with two levels of Greek Revival style porches, embellished with Doric columns, while the house is covered in a light blue-grey tinted clapboard siding. Kasbah Garden Café is a Moroccan restaurant with open-air seating in the courtyard tucked within the backyard garden and shaded with large trees. Within the restaurant, there are a small collection of tables indoors, but the interior of the restaurant extension is mostly the functioning kitchen. This building is located in the Dwight Historic District, tucked between residential houses and small apartment buildings. Across the street, on the corner of Howe and Edgewood, there are other commercial real estate including the Howe St. Laundromat, a corner-store, Pizza House, and Mamoun’s Falafel Restaurant.&nbsp;</p>','<p>N/A</p>','Home: 27\'x48\' Restaurant: 44\'x25\'','Home: 2.5; Restaurant: 1','<p>This building is separated into two parts-- a main residential building that stands two and a half stories tall and a backyard shed-style extension. The main structure is a stand-alone house which is visible from street-view. The style of the house is in Greek Revival/Late Greek Revival style popular from 1820 to 1850 [9]. The siding of building is wooden clapboard in a horizontal pattern painted in light blue-grey. On top of the residential house, there is a front-gable style medium-pitched roof sloping downwards to the left and right. The bottom two floors have extended front porch with four columns that run across the front of the porch. The columns running along the second floor porch are round, tapered and in the Doric style, while the columns running along the ground-floor porch are round, plain columns in the Doric style. The front of the building façade is punctuated with seven total windows that are rectangular in shape and functionally double-hung. The front door has a protected window at the center, with a rectangle transom atop it and two small-paned sidelights on both sides. The moldings along the windows and doors are bold, with dimensional trimmings but with minimal embellishments. Main embellishments along the front façade of the house are found on the ground-floor porch roof entablature, with small button-like circles embossing the frieze. The entirety of the building seems to be in good condition, with minimal wear on the white trim and wood framing on the porch. However, there seems to be wear on the roof as well as a bit of chipping on the front porch. The driveway up to the restaurants has wear, and doesn’t seem to have been re-paved for many years.&nbsp;</p><p>	The backyard shed has similar clapboard siding, with the patio doors of the shed opening up towards the courtyard with six large out-swinging French style doors across the side of the shed facing the courtyard. The restaurant extension was built with a hipped roof with a slight overhang which is supported by thin, square, non-tapered columns. On the back-most part of the shed, there is a separate attic space with an addendum topped with a gable roof and a pediment gable. The courtyard of the house is an open-air patio surrounded by a floral garden, with large trees providing shade for the round-table seating area of the restaurant. The shed, in comparison to the residential building seems to be in newer condition with less chipping on the wood columns—this is most likely due to its more recent construction.&nbsp;</p>','<p>Located on Howe Street, Kasbah Garden Café is tucked between stand-alone residential houses as well as low-rise apartment buildings mostly populated by off-campus undergraduate or graduate students. The location is in close proximity with Yale campus, Yale Residential Colleges and New Haven Downtown—it lies only three blocks away from the Yale Pierson residential college. Across the street, there are the Off-Broadway Apartments, as well as a corner-store and the Howe Laundromat. Less than a block away, at the intersection of Howe and Edgewood Ave, there are a handful of commercial stores including Pizza House and Mamoun’s Falafel Restaurant. The street is lined with a handful of trees, a sidewalk in semi-worn condition, and lamp-posts with advertisements for the Chapel-West neighborhood. This location is a mixed-use street—a mostly urban residential street with few commercial stores at proximate distances and intersections of streets nearby. Around a block away, there is a large parking structure connected to a larger office building, making Howe Street a convenient location for those visiting New Haven. Kasbah Garden Café is along a pleasant walk-able street that marks the edge of downtown New Haven.&nbsp;</p>','<p>	When 105 Howe Street was first construction in 1890, the Dwight Street community was “composed principally of resident artisans and laborers, of which approximately one-third were employed by one of the several carriage firms in the district. The remaining two thirds consisted largely of builders, blacksmiths, painters, and general laborers.” [5] During the 1930’s, when the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation was created by the New Deal to record and document the risk of refinancing and lending money for homes, New Haven was evaluated with these HOLC neighborhood risk maps. In 1937, 105 Howe Street was located within the C-6 District of New Haven, and designated “Third Grade/Declining” in Security and value (out of four grades). This is indicative of the process of red-lining which particularly impacted non-white, affluent neighborhoods in the prevention of attaining loans to reproduce wealth within the community—ultimately this may have resulted in stunted growth and increased delineations of wealth and class within the neighborhoods of New Haven. [10] In the HOLC map analysis of 1937, the C-6 area was predicted to have downward decline in desirability in 10-15 years due “spotty pride of ownership” and “thinness of sales market”. [10] Though this has changed since Yale has expanded its peripheral neighborhood ownership and building occupancy to Dwight street, this points to how gradually the families and “factory workers” [5, 10] were pushed outwards as Yale expanded its geographical influence—in the present day, this neighborhood is largely populated by undergraduates and graduate students at Yale University.&nbsp;</p><p>	The Greek Revival style of 105 Howe reflects a trend in the Dwight Street Historic District, when during WWI, “many revival-style apartment buildings and triple decker structures were built…to house this new population [of native and immigrant workers]”. [5] To this day, there are many remaining structures in the Greek Revival and Late Greek Revival style on Howe Street. Around the district, the visual landscape is predominantly 19<sup>th</sup>Century buildings, “brick dwellings that are set back from the street by shallow front yards and paved sidewalks”. [3]</p><p>	There remains a desire, despite the location being convenient for housing and vacancy being moderate, to enhance the “entrepreneurial direction and urban image” [8] of the neighborhood. The Chapel West Special Services Direct Vision and Strategic Plan perceive “private property owners [in] need [of] help and economic support to improve their image and business” [8] The Chapel West Special Services want to renovate the sidewalks, street amenities, and directional signage, as well as construct street furniture and implement landscaping.&nbsp;</p>','<p>105 Howe Street has gone through various transformative stages since its construction in 1890. As depicted in the 1901 Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps, they record a residential building with a frame that is not fire-resistant with a small brick two-story stable. [7] In the 1974 Sanborn Map, the backyard extension of the restaurant has already been built to accommodate Kasbah Garden Restaurant. [6] The ownership of the residence has not changed since 1977, when it was purchased by Frank S Torok, whom remains the resident and owner of 105 Howe. [12] Since the building is typically recorded in historical documents as a residence, there is little transparency as to whom had lived there prior to the current tenants. Most likely it was used as a family residence or to house students of the nearby universities, but there exists no documentation of previous ownership.</p><p><br></p>','<p><span style="background-color: white; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">[1] Amarante, Joe.

The stone apron lays a foundation for the ascending common-bonded red brick. Its simple, symmetrical design, in conjunction with homogenous, durable materials speaks to the monumentality of this historic site. It is a testament to the resilient and persevering character of the African American community it has served for over a century and a half, beginning as the Goffe Street Special School for Colored Children and eventually as The Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Masons.&nbsp;</p>','<p>The Goffe Street’s Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Masons is a two-story (plus attic and basement) brick structure originally designed by Henry Austin as a school building for African American children in the Italianate style (1). Erected in 1864, the building has remained relatively unchanged throughout time, with modifications made to the second story for the addition of a meeting hall for the Masons (1, 6).&nbsp;&nbsp;The common-bonded red brick exterior is well supported by the foundation of random ashlar extending four feet above the ground. The structure’s façade is three bays wide with 3-by-4 pane windows slightly recessed in a simple blind arcade lacking ornamentation. Firmly atop its walls lies a gabled roof covered in asphalt shingles--its wide, delineated cornice is typical of the massive proportioning popular in the 1860s (1). Extending out from the center is a Federal Rival portico, likely added after World War I, when the building was remodeled for the use as a Parish house for St. Luke’s Episcopal Church located near the Lodge on Sperry Street (1, 6).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The building’s sides are similarly proportioned—five bays wide with 3-by-4 pane windows slightly recessed into the clean, blind arcade. Bonded arches atop each second-story window echo the arcade’s crest above, adding to the structure’s pronounced verticality. When the Masonic Lodge purchased the property, the side’s outer windows (along with all four rear windows) were removed and replaced with 4-by-3 glass block windows (1, D. Branch, personal communication, Feb. 23, 2018). The alteration required a typical yet brutish solution of filling in the classical openings with new, unmatched brick. Considered necessary for privacy, it was an unfortunate interruption to the stylistic integrity and fluidity of the building. The building’s rear is two bays wide and contains a back entrance with a bracketed Victorian hood entrance at the southeast corner.</p>','<p>The Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Masons is located roughly six blocks northeast of New Haven Green. It firmly rests at the southeast corner of Sperry and Goffe Streets, also known as the Dr. Mattie Atkinson Darden corner in celebration of the African American woman who founded the Agape Christian Center, next door (8). The firehouse of Engine Company No.6, a streamline moderne structure built in 1973, expands in horizontality opposite the Masonic Lodge on Goffe Street, adjacent to the affordable retirement dwelling of St. Luke’s Senior Living. In recent years, the neighborhood has quieted down as the surrounding built environment has slowly transformed from industrial to residential (D. Branch, personal communication, Feb. 23, 2018). 20<sup>th</sup>century projects and commercial and light-industrial buildings have since been replaced by affordable housing complexes and moderate-income co-ops (1).</p>','<p>Following the Civil War, the institution of slavery began to slowly unravel in New Haven and in Connecticut, and the Goffe Street Special School for Children symbolized the African American fight for economic, social and political equality by laying one of the first educational foundations.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to moral motivations, reasons for abolition in the north included the decreasing cost-efficiency for the slave economy (2). In 1784, the Gradual Emancipation Act was passed to “phase out” slavery in Connecticut and Rhode Island, granting freedom only to those born into slavery on or after March 1, 1784 upon reaching the age of twenty-five (later reduced to twenty-one) (2, 4, 5). Many white New Haven and Yale affiliated men fought the passage of this act and worked to enforce the longevity of this law--a handful of these men later honored by Yale with the naming of residential colleges of John C. Calhoun, Samuel F. B. Morse and Ezra Stiles (2, 3). It was not until 1850 that slavery was completely phased out of Connecticut (2).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Throughout this “phasing out” process, the African American community experienced continued oppression and the denial of basic rights, namely education. As a means to circumvent laws that excluded black youth from public schools, individuals took it upon themselves to teach in their homes; the first state school house opened in 1811 (1, 6, 9). However, these schools were limited in size and resources, offering very basic education to few (9), until 1864, when a group of influential New Haven residents, including a woman named Mary Hillhouse, resolved to build a proper educational facility for the purpose of providing for “the intellectual and moral well-being of the colored people of the Town of New Haven and especially of their children… for the elevation and the benefit of the class among us, particularly in view of the fact that they have been less favored than other as well as to educational advantages” (1, 9). Mary was the daughter of famous James Hillhouse, leader of the anti-slavery movement in the First Federal Congress and Yale’s treasurer of fifty years.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mary Hillhouse bought the undeveloped land and hired prominent architect Henry Austin who donated his plan for the building (1, 9). As Elizabeth Mills Brown highlights in her book,&nbsp;<em>New Haven—A Guide to Architecture and Urban Design</em>, Austin “must have rummaged in his drawer and pulled out something that came to hand, for the building standing here today was surely once designed to be a church—note especially the side elevation” (7). Nonetheless, the building was erected with great enthusiasm among the African American and white liberal communities and completed the same year (1, 9). Hillhouse and her benefactors paid for trusteeship of the facility, while the New Haven Board of Education assumed full responsibility of the school’s educational activities (D. Branch, personal communication, Feb. 23, 2018). When the school began accepting students in January of 1865, one hundred and forty-four students were registered for attendance, and this number only grew (D. Branch, personal communication, Feb. 23, 2018). With the return of Black veterans from the Civil War, the school became a desired place for pupils of all ages (6). Beginning in 1866, the structure hosted an evening school and, in 1869, began running a nursery school (1, 9). It is even speculated that children denied access to the school for possible lack of enrollment opportunities and space would climb through two underground tunnels that led from a preexisting church across the street to the school’s yard so that they could learn for a few hours during Sunday church services (D. Branch, personal communication, Feb. 23, 2018).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In 1874, the school was forced to close after Connecticut passed legislation ending segregation (1, 6). African American children began attending previously all-white public schools, and the Trustees put the building to other uses, advancing the welfare of New Haven’s African American community (1, 6, 9). Sewing classes, church services, and even a swimming pool operated by the Colored Young Men’s Christian Association filled the vacant site (1, 9). Following World War I, the structure’s use was reimagined as a Parish House and Black Community Center by the St. Luke’s Episcopal Church (1, 9). However, with the construction of the nearby Dixwell Community Center in 1924, the Trustees felt that the need for the Goffe Street School facility had finally been diminished and decided to sell the building (1). The purchaser was the “Grand Lodge of Negro Masons”, a fraternal group deeply interested in maintaining this building’s historical background and keeping it in the care and possession of New Haven’s black community (1).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To this day, The Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Masons continues to preserve the social and structural integrity of the building. While the facility currently operates privately, each and every member is deeply committed to the community and happily welcoming of visitors. Masons are devoted volunteers, providing mentorship to black youth, offering free barbecues and clothing drives to passersby, as well as sponsoring the Walter Pop Smith Little League Baseball Team, proudly displaying their trophies alongside historical photographs, documents and relics along the walls of the first-floor social room (D. Branch, personal communication, Feb. 23, 2018).</p>','<p>According to all recoverable archival resources, there is no indication that there was any preexisting structure on this site. The National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination written by Charles W. Brilvitch asserts that the site’s history was born from Mary Hillhouse’s landpurchse of 5,000 dollars, suggesting that the land was barren prior to 1864 (1). Additionally, it is likely that the land was once part of a larger estate, later subdivided and sold to various tenants.&nbsp;</p>','<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charles W.

Formerly called the Memorial Unit of Grace-New Haven Hospital, the East Pavilion once rose high above the surrounding, non-affiliated structures. However, over time, the hospital adopted its current name and expanded its operations on the site, adding three connecting buildings. Today, the monumental East Pavilion reminds visitors of post-World War II modernism, with a visual and symbolic attachment to the Oak St. Connector and the nearby highway. In its X-shaped structure, horizontally oriented facades, and simplistic design, the East Pavilion embodies a moment in American urbanism and marks the foundation of a renowned healthcare institution.</p>','11 + basement','104\' x 82\' (irregular 4-wing shape)','<p>Grace-New Haven Hospital (1953-1965)</p><p>Renamed Yale-New Haven Hospital (1965-present)</p>','<p>	Formerly the standalone “Memorial Unit” of Grace-New Haven Hospital, the East Pavilion of Yale-New Haven Hospital represents a striking component of a massive healthcare complex that sits within a healthcare-oriented region of New Haven. Douglas Orr’s simple, modernist, concrete structure rises amidst a cluttered assemblage of connecting buildings, each constructed in a different decade. However, the building’s symmetrical, X-shaped plan seems to have anticipated this expansion, as two of the East Pavilion’s wings now directly connect to the additions. While the East Pavilion does not form a perfect cross, the structure shares the simplistic, modern monumentality of Le Corbusier’s “Radiant City” towers.</p><p>	The East Pavilion’s four wings extend from an octagonal central node, which rises two stories above the rest of the building. Built in 1953, with the addition of the 9<sup>th</sup>and 10<sup>th</sup>floors in 1972, the building’s historical alterations remain subtly visible in the shifting of the window pattern. The exterior exudes horizontality, noticeably in conversation with the geometry of the adjacent parking structure, various bridged pathways, the street, and the nearby highway. The blue coloring that alternates with the beige sections provides this horizontal alternation and declares the structures affiliation with Yale, which is reiterated by the building’s fencing and signage.&nbsp;</p>','<p>	As one of Yale-New Haven Hospital’s four pavilions, the East Pavilion no longer reads as an independent structure. In addition to the East Pavilion, the block enclosed by York Street, South Frontage Road, Park Street, and Howard Avenue boasts the South Pavilion, the Yale-New Haven Children\'s Hospital (West Pavilion), and the Smilow Cancer Hospital at Yale-New Haven. These buildings rise across the street from the massive Yale School of Medicine, which spans two blocks. The area is enclosed on one side by a two-block, multi-story, modernist parking structure, which signifies a functional and architectural shift as one enters the neighborhood. Beyond the shadows of the parking garage, which also houses two fast-food chains, the visitor emerges into a distinctly medical area, with the East Pavilion to the right and the Yale Medical School to the left.&nbsp;</p>','<p>	Yale University’s ties to the hospital predate the facility’s formal name change in 1965 from “Grace-New Haven Community Hospital” to “Yale-New Haven Hospital” (2). At the foundation of the Memorial Unit, the two entities signed “a Joint Declaration of Policy concerning mutual support of professional education and patient care programs and the required facilities” (3). The Memorial Unit’s renaming as the East Pavilion did not change the function of the building, which has remained relatively constant since its erection. However, as the Yale-New Haven Hospital expanded, certain functional aspects shifted, prompting interior renovations and remodeling.&nbsp;</p><p>	While the East Pavilion has seen little to no change in ownership, tenancy, function, and organization, the building’s construction paved the way for future expansion, ultimately characterizing the surrounding area as a medical metropolis. The hospital’s relative ease in dominating the block enclosed by York St., S. Frontage Rd., Park St., and Howard Ave. can be attributed to the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation’s redlining tactics. In 1937, the HOLC marked the neighborhood within a yellow (or “definitely declining”) district. The report’s clarifying remarks describe the area’s “detrimental influences” as “age&nbsp;of dwellings as well as bad odors from the south where there is a rubber plant situated” (4). The report identified the population as mixed-race, further priming the land for assumption by a more powerful entity. Only a decade later, the Grace-New Haven Hospital’s Memorial Unit marked the beginning of an expansion that has enveloped the community.&nbsp;</p><p>	The East Pavilion’s renovations—specifically in conversation with the adjacent Yale School of Medicine—spread Yale’s visible influence throughout the area. The repainting (in “Yale Blue”) of both the building’s exterior and the surrounding fencing and signage draws a visible attachment between the educational and healthcare facilities. While Yale’s campus does not form a continuous presence along York Street, the East Pavilion, its renovations, the hospital’s additions, and the Yale School of Medicine position the area as a distinctly Yale region of the city.</p>','<p>	The East Pavilion of Yale-New Haven Hospital sits on a site with a history of residential, religious, and commercial use. In 1886, the site housed a tenement building, residential units, and St. Elizabeth’s Convent, which would later become St. John’s Convent (5, 6, 7). An 1879 hand-drawn map represents the residential units in narrow, row-house forms (8). In 1911, the tenement building moved across York Street, prompting the development of more residential units. The site housed a predominantly Italian and Anglo-American community, with residents like Ganeto Givia, Mary Godley, and Geo Montano (9). In 1917, commercial entities opened on the site: the tailor Jacob Krantz followed by “The Folding Mattress Co.” and an auto dealer/repair shop in 1924 (7 and 10).&nbsp;</p><p>	In 1953, the Grace-New Haven Hospital opened its Memorial Unit on the site. Designed by the Office of Douglas Orr, a renowned architecture firm, the building marked the first of many additions that would come to fill the block. After the 1972 addition of two stories to the Memorial Unit, the (renamed) Yale-New Haven Hospital built the South Pavilion (1982), the West Pavilion (1993), and Smilow Cancer Hospital (2009) (2). An atrium was also constructed in 1993 to provide a central connection between the Pavilions.</p>','<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Memorial Unit, Yale New Haven Hospital,” Historic Resources Inventory: Building and Structures, New Haven Preservation Trust, Compiled by Preston Maynard, 1981. http://newhavenmodern.org/all-buildings?dir=asc&amp;order=date.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="background-color: white; color: rgb(50, 50, 50);">"History and Heritage."

Bricks (both smooth and rough), a darkish metal that appears to be aluminum or a cheap alloy, glass, and concrete make up what is visible to a viewer from the outside.</p><p>Especially, the building stretches 100 feet in length, 20 ft. in width, and 30 ft. in height split across among two floors.<sup>[</sup><a href="about:blank" target="_blank" style="color: black;"><sup>[2]</sup></a><sup>]</sup>Each floor’s 20,000 square feet are used for class room facilities, eating areas, offices, a reception area, among various miscellaneous rooms and storage closets.</p><p>Constructed to serve the purpose it does, the building’s compact, rigid, and simple exterior emanate an impenetrable aura of assuredness, perhaps best marked by the building’s glass front door, which reads, “THIS DOOR LEADS TO YOUR FUTURE.”</p><p><br></p><p><a href="about:blank" target="_blank">[1]</a>City of New Haven, Office of Building Inspection &amp; Enforcement, Permit Numbers 97409, 97705, 97705, 98078, 98192, 1988.</p><p><a href="about:blank" target="_blank">[2]</a>City of New Haven, Office of Building Inspection &amp; Enforcement, 580 Boulevard Height &amp; Area Computations, 1988.</p>','<p>	First proposed in 1987 to sit atop an empty piece of land of 0.42 acres, the New Haven Adult Education Center is situated on what today is known as Ella T. Grasso Boulevard.<sup>[</sup><a href="about:blank" target="_blank" style="color: black;"><sup>[1]</sup></a><sup>][</sup><a href="about:blank" target="_blank" style="color: black;"><sup>[2]</sup></a><sup>]</sup>(Formerly known as “Boulevard,” the street was renamed after Connecticut’s late governor, Ms. Ella Tambussi Grasso, who was known for her liberal, Democratic political style.<sup>[</sup><a href="about:blank" target="_blank" style="color: black;"><sup>[3]</sup></a><sup>]</sup>) The street follows the eastern bank of the West River and provides easy access to various recreational centers along the river, including the West River Peace Garden.&nbsp;</p><p>	The Center’s specific locale is an educational strip mall known as the New Haven Career Campus, which lies within the bend of the West River. The Career Campus includes several educational facilities, management offices, and employment programs meant to help New Haven residents. It also sits adjacent to the more-traditional commercial strip mall (the New Haven Plaza) that is home to a diner, sausage-making restaurant, motor store, paint shop, and occasional flea market. An interview with a New Haven resident, Tyisha, who is friends with many scholars at the Center informed me that the general perception of the Center and the area in which it sits is heavily damaged by its proximity to the Columbus House, which she informed me used to serve as a homeless shelter; the shelter, she explained, had hours in which its residents were forced to leave the premises (likely a requirement that is meant to facilitate job search), and many of them, with no where else to go and frigid conditions outside, would often just spend their days inside the Adult Education Center.<sup>[</sup><a href="about:blank" target="_blank" style="color: black;"><sup>[4]</sup></a><sup>]</sup>This has made it so the primary association with the Center is negative, though she fully stands behind the “great resources” it provides.<sup>[</sup><a href="about:blank" target="_blank" style="color: black;"><sup>[5]</sup></a><sup>]</sup></p><p>	According to government documents from New Haven’s Office of City Planning, the&nbsp;&nbsp;section of the river in which the New Haven Career Campus is squished was fairly underdeveloped at the inception of building plans for the Center: preceding the building’s construction was an infrastructure project that, among other things, established a 2,000 square foot easement for recreation.<sup>[</sup><a href="about:blank" target="_blank" style="color: black;"><sup>[6]</sup></a><sup>]</sup>Sharing a parking lot with the Center is a preschool, the Helene Grant School, and the Riverside Education Academy, a transitional high school (on 540 and 560 Ella T. Grasso Boulevard, respectively). Like the Center, each is part of the Board of Education’s robust educational programs for the City.&nbsp;</p><p>	Across the street is Saint Bernard’s Cemetary that, unfortunately for the City of New Haven’s educational efforts, is more likely to capture the eyes of passing-by drivers than the Career Campus and the Adult Education Center, which overlook a fairly large, ordinary parking lot that would be hard-pressed to garner attention. Overall, the Center’s surrounding area is relatively serene and unruffled compared to the bustling downtown area.</p><p><br></p><p><a href="about:blank" target="_blank">[1]</a>The New Haven Property Look Up, 580 Ella T Grasso Boulevard, by Vision Government Solutions.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="about:blank" target="_blank">[2]</a>City of New Haven, Office of Building Inspection &amp; Enforcement, Commission Coastal Site Plan Review Report 1049-9, 1987.</p><p><a href="about:blank" target="_blank">[3]</a>Connecticut Women’s Hall of Fame, The Virtual Hall - Ella Tambussi Grasso.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="about:blank" target="_blank">[4]</a>Tyisha, Interview by Rayan Alsemeiry, February 26, 2018.</p><p><a href="about:blank" target="_blank">[5]</a>Tyisha, Interview.</p><p><a href="about:blank" target="_blank">[6]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;City of New Haven, Office of Building Inspection &amp; Enforcement, Report 1049-9, 1987, 1.</p>','<p>	A recent study by Literacy for New Haven found that 30 percent of adults in New Haven either have not completed high school or are functionally illiterate.<sup>[</sup><a href="about:blank" target="_blank" style="color: black;"><sup>[1]</sup></a><sup>]</sup>To address this need, the New Haven Adult Education Center was commissioned in 1987.

democracy.”</span><a href="about:blank" target="_blank" style="color: fuchsia;">[4]</a><span style="color: windowtext;">It would be “a testimonial to the community ideals of New Haven’s Jewish people

these community ideals, the construction had religious and historic significance for the Jewish Community: it would occur at the juncture of Rosh Hashanah and the centennial anniversary of the Jewish Center Movement in the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp;The migration from the Dwight Street building into the new, modernist Center on Chapel Street was likened to the revitalization of the State of Israel, the promised land of dreams that had become a reality.</span><a href="about:blank" target="_blank" style="color: fuchsia;">[6]</a><span style="color: windowtext;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps coincidence, though perhaps spurring his selection, four years before his commission, Louis Kahn had returned from a trip to Israel, on invitation from the Israeli Government, to study the state’s planning and building program.</span><a href="about:blank" target="_blank" style="color: fuchsia;">[7]</a></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: windowtext;">Eventually, in the late 1970s, the Jewish Community had migrated westward, and the Chapel Street building’s upkeep was costly.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was “perceived as inaccessible and unsafe by [a] large portion of existing and potential membership,” and there was “no guarantee of overcoming locational stigma” if the community were to undergo an expensive renovations project.</span><a href="about:blank" target="_blank" style="color: fuchsia;">[8]</a><span

Taft Mansion is a two story French Second Empire style mansion across the street from the New Haven Museum on the busy Whitney Avenue that connects New Haven and Hamden. Despite being originally constructed in 1870, the building has been maintained beautifully, such that its condition could be likened to that of a building recently renovated. It was only owned by former president William H. Taft from around the time of the first World War to 1921, and Taft, a Yale graduate, never actually lived in the mansion that is encircled today by the ubiquitous Yale campus. The facade is pleasingly almost symmetrical, except for a difference in window spacing. It is constructed with load-bearing masonry and the exterior is done in stucco. The basement, which is visible from the driveway to the 23 space parking lot behind the building, is faced in stone. The building was historically a residence and then a business school, but is now home to the offices of Ivy Labs, a private education consulting firm that helps students apply to colleges. </span></p>','2 & A & B','40\' x 60\'','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">William H.

The roof line is trapezoidal as is the Mansard style of French Second Empire. The building is painted a shade of goldenrod with the shutters and trims done in a forest green. The cornice at the roofline is white, and the dentil work is broken by pairs of modillions. It is a symmetrical, rectangular building, with the only flaw being irregular window spacing on one side of the facade. The porch is projected outwards and there is a pair of glass double doors. There are hedges in the front yard that line the walkway and the roof of the porch is held up with cast iron supports. The back of the building has the emergency fire escape and an entryway to the basement. The interior is elegantly furnished, and there is an abundance of archways and mouldings and paneled walls. The central staircase is not designed to be the center of attention. There is a small foyer, past which is a hall with a large office to the left and a grand hall to the right, which might have once been used for entertaining. The fixtures are all in keeping with the refined taste and style of the Second Empire. The dormers and windows used to be arched in the 1930s and there was also a cast iron fence, which was removed at some point. The structure is secured with load-bearing masonry and a trap rock foundation. The building was extensively remodeled in 2008.</span></p><p><br></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The mansion faces an important artery connecting Downtown New Haven with the town center of Hamden, across the street from the colonial revival New Haven Museum and flanked by a 20th century office building and a series of shops. Further up Whitney Avenue are many eateries and offices.</span></p><p><br></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The building’s namesake, William H. Taft, imparted an esteem to the mansion simply by owning it (Secondary sources, 7).</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">When it was first constructed it was on the outskirts of town, just on the edge of the settlement (Maps, 1). Like how Fifth Avenue mansions were constructed on what used to be considered “out of town” in New York, the client might have wanted an escape from the burgeoning city of New Haven. This could have started a trend that carried on for many years in which large mansions designed by architects were constructed further along Whitney Avenue and led to the development of what is now know was the Whitney Avenue Historic District (Secondary sources, 5). It is important to note that the William H. Taft Mansion is not actually included in the district. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The mansion was also home to the William F. Buckley Jr. Program for three years. The program was a conservative group founded in the face of a heavy political atmosphere on campus that gave the impression to the founding students that they could not voice their opinions freely (Secondary sources, 3, 4, 6). The program received an an anonymous donation to move into the building with the option to buy the building after two years, at a cost of 2 million dollars (Secondary sources, 3, 4). The students wanted to make this mansion a place that was welcoming enough such that student fellows of Yale would hold meetings there and study breaks. In some ways, the housing of this organization breathed some of the building’s faded political important back. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The building currently houses Ivy Labs, which calls itself a private education consulting group and its goal is to help their clients through the college application process and help them gain admission into top institutions (Secondary sources, 2). </span></p><p><br></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In 1851, the William H. Taft Mansion did not exist yet, since 111 Whitney Avenue was an empty lot. Construction finished in 1870, and the building has stood ever since. The parking lot behind the mansion has existed at least since 1980. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In a 1936 photo, the building had a slate roof, arched dormers and windows, an ornamental bay window on the south side, and a cast iron fence. Today there is no fence, there is no bay window on the south side, the dormers and windows are square, and the roof is asphalt and shingles. </span></p><p><br></p>','<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Documents: </span></p><ol><li><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Hudnall, Amy L.

This makes the space a suitably rentable space for three separate families. The location boasts proximity to a community garden and was once home to Winchester Repeating Arms factory employees due to its close location to the site.[1] It has remained a residence throughout its history, one with a beautiful mansard roof and bay windows on all stories in the front and back, though it has fallen into disrepair.</p>','40\' x 24\' ','3 +unfinished basement','<p>Alfred E.

Crocker (1923-?); Ellis Odessa (1986-2001)</p>','<p>The three-story space is topped with a mansard roof that is only present on the facade, which is repeated with flared, shingled roofs above and below the two box bay windows that sit atop the entryway. The top story’s 90-degree angle bay windows contain jalousie windows, contrasted with the single hung windows on the second story that are repeated throughout the rest of the building. Atop the third story’s bay window is a pediment, and directly to the right of those bay windows are a second set, this time with one side hidden by the other bay windows and the other side at a 120-degree angle, making for an interesting roof line. The covered porch extends under both bay windows, supported by clusters of Tuscan order columns that sprout off of a brick railing, which, in turn, is supported by columns of bricks. Stone steps descend toward the side walk. To the right of the second set of bay windows is three more single-hung windows stacked atop each other; the bottom two are each bordered with white shutters with four blue squares painted inside each one. The same pattern is repeated on either side of the double doors, one of which is labelled 525. Both doors are burgundy with three rectangle windows in a diagonal pattern. Single hung windows adorn the sides as well, and another three bay windows go down the back in a column. HOLC also condemned the neighborhood with a C rating in 1937, changing the current face of the neighborhood and most likely leading indirectly to the debilitated nature of the exterior.[2]</p>','<p>Bordered on one side by the Healthy Community Garden, part of a larger movement to encourage more neighborhood greenery in Newhallville,[3] and by an empty lot on the other, the house sits within the sparse neighborhood of Newhallville. The corner across Division St from the residence is populated by Moe’s Market, a convenience store.</p>','<p>The building has remained residential throughout its history, like most current buildings in Newhallville.[4] Most likely changing in demographics from Newhall employees to WPA employees, and most likely shifted from white to black as the majority shifted. The current demographics of the block in which the site resides is 88.4% black, as well as 43.6% single female and 36.4% single person (Overview of Block 141500-6-002, New Haven County, Connecticut).</p>','<p>The first known inhabitants of the Newhallville neighborhood region were German and Irish settlers who immigrated in the early 1800s via the Farmington Canal which ran through the area. This canal later became a railway, and then a greenway which runs close to the site itself. One of the first prosperous industries in the region was the Newhall Carriage Emporium, owned by George T. Newhall, the namesake of the neighborhood – though his business would fail in 1871, this would mark the success of his region as a residential neighborhood which had grown relatively slowly in the 1850s and 60s. This neighborhood eventually would thrive as Winchester Repeating Arms Company moved in nearby, which would peak production in World War II with 19,000 employees and took up six city blocks.

Rush operated a roofing and urethane installation company called Urethane Application Inc. out of the newly refurbished structure. Rush sold to Patrick Palmieri, proprietor of Palmieri Foods Inc., in 1995; 656 thus became Palmieri’s Food Terminal. </span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Long before moving to Grand Street, the Palmieris had built a business off their home-style pasta sauces.

The two-story building is architecturally designed to embody the French Quarter with features like a street-facing facade, cast-iron balcony, and decorative shutters. Located in the Whalley-Dixwell neighborhood, Popeye’s is easily accessible for New Haven residents as well as Yale University students. The chain manages to appeal to both diverse groups due to proximity, affordable prices, delicious food, and a community atmosphere created by the interior organization and red-orange color scheme.</p>','<p>None</p>','sub-3000 sq. ft.','2','<p>Approaching Popeye’s from a distance, the eye is immediately drawn to the unusually warm signature colors of red, orange, and white. On the front facing Whalley Ave, “Popeye’s” is written in white bubble letters with “Louisiana Kitchen” written underneath in white letters on a red background. The same logo is written on the left side to increase the chances of cars coming from the left seeing the restaurant with enough time to stop. Both signs are placed on the expanse of brownish orange wall that covers most of the building and is bordered with red on top as part of the flat roof. Underneath each logo is a red overhang divided into rectangles that look almost like shingles. Above each logo are a set of green gooseneck lights that match the green decorative shutters located on the pushed back wings of the street-facing facade. Underneath the red overhang on both the front and left side are wall-length windows that continue until the last three feet to the ground. Below the windows, the wall continues in a dark brown color bordered with red on top. Looking from the front, the entry double doors are to the left and right sides, not directly facing the street. The main entrance is to the left facing the parking lot. The right side of the building, contrary to the left, continues the expanse of brownish orange wall relatively low to the ground and without extra decoration.&nbsp;</p><p>Entering from Goffe St, a two-story square box in the same colors as the main building comes into view: the drive thru. The same brown bottom with a red border transitions into the brown-orange expanse of wall that contains the drive thru slide window. On the car-facing front, a green iron balcony overhangs the window and is embellished with two decorative green shutters that match the ones on the front of the main building. The right side of the building has the same red overhang with the same green gooseneck lights above. There’s also a sign that says “Drive-Thru Open” stationed between the lights. Under the red overhang to the right side is a brown door for staff use only. The path the cars should take through the drive thru lot is outlined in yellow lines with yellow arrows indicating the direction of traffic. In the main parking lot, there is a tall sign angled towards the traffic moving the opposite direction on the other side of the street so that the building is advertising from every possible entry angle.</p><p>The interior of Popeye’s architectural design is in line with the brand’s goals of “authenticity, originality, fun, food-orientation” (Interior Design). There is a horizontal orientation with the ordering counter being at the back and the tables and booths being to either side. In entering, the customers are guided to the front through a path leading to the counter. The high ceilings and tables pushed back against the walls create a sense of space and freedom of movement. To the right, tables with free-standing chairs are lined up against the large windows, creating a sense of unity with the external environment and releasing feelings of enclosure or crowdedness. To the left, there are several booths also pushed against the window that offer more comfortable and private eating space. The floors are tiled and the chairs, tables, and booths are made of wood with accents of red rail or cushion to match the brand’s colors.</p><p>Popeye’s is primarily influenced by the architectural design of the French Quarter, which includes a harmonious mix of Art Nouveau, Art Deco, French Colonial, and Spanish Colonial (Marc Lortie). The cast iron balcony and colorful hues are both borrowed from the mixture of French, Spanish, Creole, and American architecture that defines New Orleans even today (French Quarter Architecture). Breaking away from historical styles, Art Nouveau focuses on organic and geometric forms with an emphasis on linear contours, which can be seen in the long, linearity of the walls and sides of Popeye’s (Art Nouveau Movement). Art Nouveau paved the way for Art Deco in the 1920s. This new popular style, similar to Art Nouveau, attempted to “infuse functional objects with artistic touches” as part of a “pursuit of beauty in all aspects of life” (Art Deco Movement). One of the goals was to improve the appearance of mass-produced buildings as would become Popeye’s. The French Colonial style became popular in Louisiana with French Colonization, and Popeye’s borrowed key elements such as the green shutters (French Quarter). The influence of Spanish Colonial is also present as seen with the flat roof, colorful walls and roofs, and ironwork balconies (French Quarter). Historically, most of the Quarter’s French colonial style was destroyed in the Great New Orleans Fire, leaving the Spanish to rebuild (French Quarter).</p>','<p>Popeye’s is located on the strip between Whalley Ave and Goffe St, which both begin in a cluster of streets, including Broadway, Dixwell Ave, and Tower Pkwy, that start together and radiate outwards towards their respective residential areas. Whalley Ave is a significant location for providing business in that it is a major commercial strip extending back to include places like Stop &amp; Shop, CVS, McDonald’s, Dunkin’ Donuts, and Walgreens. The strip is surrounded by residential neighborhoods on one side (Dwight, Edgewood, Beaver Hills, Dixwell) and Yale University on the other, making the restaurant a nearby option for anyone looking for a quick, affordable meal of spicy New Orleans style chicken. Due to the plethora of commercial stores on Whalley Ave coupled with the low-income residential areas and college university surrounding it, it makes sense that the busy road would be chosen as a spot for Popeye’s. Considering the city as a whole, Whalley Ave is a prominent commercial avenue that breaks the typical grid-like pattern of residential areas and the streets surrounding the college campus. Noting that the location of Popeye’s is on a commercial strip rather than off of highway 91 or 95, it becomes clear that the restaurant was primarily meant for New Haven residents.&nbsp;</p><p>Taking a closer look, Popeye’s is located behind a gas station, across the street from a Courtyard by Marriott Hotel, behind the Zeta frat house, and next to an abandoned UPS building. The gas station takes up the first chunk of space on the triangular strip between Whalley Ave and Goffe St. Behind that is the frat house Zeta, which is known as one of the football frats. To the left and across Goffe St there is Dixwell Lot, which provides parking spaces in addition to the fourteen or so located to the right side in Popeye’s own lot. The proximity of the Marriott Hotel and gas station points travellers in the direction of Popeye’s, which offers quick food perfect for a road trip or a sit down lunch with the family before heading home. Next to the Zeta frat house, but also about 100 yards from frat row, Popeye’s has become a late-night snack destination for Yale students, and occasionally Quinnipiac students who travel to Yale for the night. The abandoned UPS store behind Popeye’s goes mostly unnoticed by customers who approach the front entrance from Whalley Ave.</p>','<p>Popeye’s, being a commercial chain, puts a lot of thought and consideration into each building location, weighing the costs and benefits to determine overall chance of success. Popeye’s was built in New Haven in 1987 with the intention of continuing to spread Louisiana culture and cuisine, but also to appeal to the residents of New Haven. Before franchising, the chain considers “competition, economic and demographic data, and geography” (Franchising FAQ ). The 1976 Sanborn map shows that the area that would become Popeye’s was a parking lot, the space that would become the gas station was vacant, and the majority of the strip was occupied by corporations like Continental Baking Co, Auto Sales and Service, and Auto Body Repair, or residential dwellings. The buildings on the other side of Whalley Ave also contained corporations and residential homes as well as the Holiday Inn Motel. In contrast, the street today is more populated with restaurants such as El Amigo Felix, Basil, and Sushi Mizu.</p><p>To understand the change that happened, it is necessary to consider New Haven as a whole. While the current estimated median household income in 2016 was $40,457, it was $29,604 in 2000, and presumably even lower in the 1980s (New Haven, Connecticut). I believe the economic difference between Yale University and the surrounding city prompted the gradual bettering of New Haven. For example, on the corner of York St and Broadway, what used to be a Au Bon Pain is now a Patagonia store. The replacement of cheaper stores with more elite ones overtime has pushed New Haven residents farther away from the University. It is for this reason that the existence of affordable chains is so important. I think Popeye’s chose New Haven as a location because of the low-income residents and the proximity to Yale University. They also chose a spot away from the other chains on Chapel St. and farther up Whalley Ave because there is no immediate competition in the area, and they’re closer to the residential areas for people who want to travel walking distance.&nbsp;</p><p>Currently, Popeye’s is owned by Keith and Julia Solomon. Being operated by individuals instead of a corporation has given the New Haven location a more community-oriented and inviting vibe (New Haven). For example, in 2014, the Solomon’s arranged for 550 free turkey meals to be served to the community on Thanksgiving (New Haven). Having no children of their own, the Solomon’s consider their employees and customers to be family (New Haven). In turn, the community considers Popeyes like home. According to regular customer Lotheria Nelson, her three-year old granddaughter calls out, “Popeyes!” every time they pass the restaurant (New Haven).</p>','<p>Although the building containing Popeye’s was itself built in 1987 for the purpose of being a Popeye’s, the lot was used for different things over time. (Note: Because of the creation of spot 35 and spot 35c, it is difficult to distinguish between the two on the older maps):</p><p>1886-1953:Residential space (In the New Haven Directories, names were listed)</p><p>1953: Auto Collision Repair</p><p>1967: Acme Auto Body Inc</p><p>1971: Vacant</p><p>1973: Gino’s Restaurant Inc</p><p>1976: Part of the lot converted into a parking lot. Gino’s remains</p><p>1982: Parking lot. Gino’s building gone.</p><p>1987: Popeyes famous fried chicken and biscuits</p><p>Looking at the 1886 Sanborn Map, it becomes clear that Whalley Ave was always one of the main avenues starting at the other end of the city as Grand ave, then Elm st, then Whalley Ave. Whalley Ave itself extends outwards from the initial 9-square plan for New Haven, which alludes to the shared use of the road by both city center and outward residential area people.</p><p>The tip of the widening strip between Goffe and Whalley has been occupied by several corporations, but also residential homes over time. In 1886, the top part where Popeye’s now sits was occupied by a cluster of buildings. The 1911 Atlas shows the evolution of this space with the current Popeye’s being occupied by the homes of H.E. Todd and F. Thompson. The space was used as a residential home until 1953 when a building in the space behind lot 35, 35c, was created to house Auto Collision Repair (New Haven Directory) . In 1967, the business was replaced by ACME Auto Body Inc and in 1972, the lot was transformed into Gino’s Inc and Gino’s Restaurant (New Haven Directory) . By 1982 the buildings were scrapped and the space turned into a parking lot (New Haven Directory). It is in this empty space that Popeyes was built in 1987. As the area surrounding Whalley Ave and Goffe St developed into populated suburbs, the widening strip became more important to daily life and corporations were replaced by everyday stores like Walgreens and Stop &amp; Shop.</p>','<p>“Art Nouveau Movement, Artists and Major Works.” The Art Story.</p><p><br></p><p>"Franchising FAQ | Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen."

It combines Beaux Arts style and Neoclassical architectural elements to great a grand structure that stands as a symbol of justice and magnificence.</p>','105 feet wide by 250 feet long','4 levels (3 stories plus a basement)','<p>The design for the New Haven County Courthouse was inspired by St. George’s Hall in Liverpool, England [10]. This antecedent synthesized neoclassical architecture with neo-Grecian elements. The façade of St. George’s Hall had 16 Corinthian columns, a large tympanum, and two statues flanking the main entryway. The New Haven County Courthouse, in comparison, is on a much smaller scale, but still has many parallels with St. George’s Hall; for example, both buildings have colonnaded porticoes on three sides and monumental stairs leading to the main entrance.</p><p><em>Beaux Arts Influence</em></p><p>The Beaux Arts style can be seen with the rational organization of space inside the Courthouse: jury deliberation rooms are located above courtrooms, prisoner cellblocks are located beneath the first-floor courtrooms for quick transportation, vertical circulation limited movement of juries and prisoners around the building. Even more, the use of statuary outside the building and utilization hierarchy of scale—the more important doors at the front of the building are higher elevated than the more diminutive side-doors—also draw from European influences [3].</p><p><em>Neoclassical Influence</em></p><p>Evidence of neoclassical characteristics can be evidenced by specific design decisions made both inside and outside of the courthouse. Inside, the main doorway opens up into a long hall with high ceilings and a curved vault that appears to invite light from the heavens. Outside, the façade is outlined by 6 massive, unfluted Ionic columns [5]. These neoclassical influences coalesce into a grandiose aesthetic that fit the City Beautiful narrative and the intent of the building; to add beauty to the urban landscape and serve as a symbol of grandeur.</p><p><em>Overall Architecture</em></p><p>In its most fundamental sense, the courthouse follows a rectangular plan with the south side facing the green as the main façade [9]. The building itself is adorned with white marble. The architects employed a lot of vertical movement with their design choices. First, the three flights of steps invite viewers to look up and climb toward the entrance towards some higher, better place. The six Ionic columns complement this movement, forcing viewers to literally look up to see the top of the building, where they are greeted with a grand tympanum that sits on top of an entablature that unites all of the columns. The tympanum showcases depictions of Justice, Victory, Precedence, Accuracy, Common Law, Statutory Law, and Commerce; the central figure is the Goddess of Justice seated on a Greek throne [1]. Each story of the building has windows that open to the street, with the first-floor windows flanking a large double-door that invite people inside and the second-floor windows standing alone with pointed pediments [4].</p><p>The other sides of the building have many analogous elements to the south façade. The east and west sides also have six Ionic Greek columns and a continuous entablature. Distinctively, between the windows on these sides are panels mounting seals of Justice and Authority. All of these elements espousing vertical movement that push the viewer’s gaze upward accentuates the building’s aesthetic as a grand expression of the City Beautiful movement. The building stretches towards the skies as if it were a holy place; a place for where there is Justice.</p>','<p>New Haven, as a city, was planned as a grid of nine squares by its founders in 1638. The central square was set aside as a common space for public, now known as the New Haven Green. Over time, the Green has remained the physical and metaphorical center of New Haven, playing an important role in defining the city’s identity and civic climate.</p><p>The monumental architectural style of the Courthouse harmonized by its location along the Green creates a symbol of justice. The building stands like a bastion of rightness and a better tomorrow. The building is located at the intersection of Elm and Church streets and is visible and accessible from both the sidewalk and the Green to its south. Moreover, the building is bordered to the east by Church Street, on the west by the Free Library of New Haven, and to the north by a parking lot.</p>','<p>The commission of the New Haven County Courthouse was a product of the New Haven City Beautiful movement when the New Haven Civic Improvement Commission recommended sweeping changes to enhance the city’s urban landscape into a more aesthetic environment for the city’s inhabitants. Architects during this time saw urban spaces as intrinsically related to public welfare and made it a point to leverage building as a tool to beautify cities. The social importance of the New Haven County Courthouse is closely related to its legal history and its architectural distinctiveness.</p><p><em>Judicial</em></p><p>The legal history of the New Haven County Courthouse is one that is shaped by the cases that have been fought there. A number of the first cases heard at the Courthouse were of both state and national importance, with some cases eventually reaching the US Supreme Court on appeal. Nevertheless, the two most important cases in the Courthouse’s history came in recent years, namely Connecticut v. Griswold and the Black Panther trial.</p><p>Fought in 1965, the Griswold v. Connecticut case determined that Connecticut’s anti-contraceptive law, that found the use of a contraceptive a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of at least $40, 50 days of imprisonment, or both, to be unconstitutional [11]. This case immediately affected Connecticut laws and set influential precedents in future cases such as Roe v. Wade.</p><p>On the civil rights front, in 1970, the Black Panther Trials in New Haven were seen as a defining moment for the American Judicial system; a moment when American institutions were able to react to dramatic circumstances in a peaceful manner [11]. When Bobby Seale, National Chairman of the Black Panther Party, and Ericka Huggins, a Black Panther member went on trial in 1970 at the New Haven Courthouse, the trial was seen as a test of the American criminal justice system’s ability to give black revolutionaries a fair trial.</p><p><em>Architectural</em></p><p>The architects of the New Haven County Courthouse employed a combination of Beaux Arts design principles and Neoclassical style. From a high-level view, the building was monumental and intended to convey both a firm sense of justice but also beauty. The Courthouse was among the earliest civic Beaux Arts buildings constructed in New Haven and remains a reminder of the City Beautiful movement.</p><p>For the most part, the Courthouse has not changed a lot over the years. Today, many of the original structural and physical elements remain. For example, the East side double-doors today are still the original doors, with much of the original glass [2]! Much of the marble inside has remained the same; but dulled over the years and from tar from smoking, which was once allowed within the building.</p><p>Nonetheless, over the years, the Courthouse has survived many threats of demolition. As early as January 1956, the Courthouse was slated for either extensive renovation or demolition to allow the building to encompass more judicial functions but was saved by modernization projects that added new air and electrical systems in 1957.</p><p>In January of 2013, the Courthouse underwent a 4-million-dollar renovation project by the JCJ Architecture Firm. Many aesthetic touches were done to the south façade, parts of the roof were patched up, and hanging fixtures were rejuvenated.</p>','<p>In 1907, a committee found that the existing county courthouses were inadequate for New Haven’s needs. The northwest corner of Elm and Church Streets, facing the Green, was picked because of the location’s centrality to other civic, institutional, and religious buildings in the city [8]. Before the 1900s, the site was the site of the wealthy home of the New Haven elite. </p><p>After a design competition, the white marble neoclassical design submitted by the architectural firm of Allen and Williams was commissioned for the job; this design was lauded for its emphasis on classical monumentality and elegance, a perfect expression of the City Beautiful.</p>','<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tympanum Victory, 121 Elm Street.

Originally designed by Henry Austin for the residential dwelling of James E. English, who later became the Governor of Connecticut, this stately villa, with its box-design, symmetrical six pane upper window sashes, low-hipped roof with broad overhanging eaves is an image of elegance in its simplicity (1). There is considerable evidence of Austin’s rich but restrained detail, as passersby may marvel at the façade porch and its intricate, floral columns as well as the reserved but playful scallop cornice molding as they meander along the Wooster Square Historic District (3).&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Walking along the neighborhood, the James English house’s grandeur simultaneously blends in with the stately villas of the district as well as stands out as an elongated, grandiose building that serves grieving families with dignity, elegance and grace today. The James English house is a living testimony to the changing tides of residential and commercial districts, with its own conversion from the former to the latter riding the shifting waves of the revered neighborhood itself.&nbsp;</span></p>','3','38\' x 68\'','<p>1845: James E. English</p><p>1920: Maresca &amp; Sons Funeral Home </p>','<p>Upon looking at this 19<sup>th</sup>century Italianate style villa, the three bay flat-roofed façade porch, supported by its rosette-patterned balustrade, immediately captures the viewer’s attention (1). This three-story brick building, with its paired twin interior chimneys, low hip roof coupled with broad overhanging eaves creates a characteristically Italianate yet simple and elegant look fitting of the building’s first tenant, James E. English, who served in the U.S. Congress and was later elected the Governor of Connecticut (1, 4). The wooden belt-course molding along the top of the second floor visually represents the original roofline before the third story was annexed shortly after the building’s construction, creating the building’s elongated exterior and spacious interior today (1, 4, 5). The building’s light brown exterior, broken up only with wooden bands of molding encompassing the house sets a simple and austere atmosphere of the Italianate villa. The uniformity of the windows around the building, with original six pane upper window sashes enclosing all sides, unify the James English house to allude to the prominence and servitude of the original tenant’s active engagement in civic affairs and the current tenant’s mission for serving families (1, 2).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>','<p>Situated just east of Wooster Square, this building’s exterior echoes the large, fashionable styles of its environment while assimilating the natural beauty of Wooster Square Park. Today, the buildings located around the James English house are mainly operated for light commercial purposes, but the built environment surrounding the building stems from a range of mid- to late-nineteenth century villas and dwellings (1). Walking along the beautiful historic district of Wooster Square, the stately villas in addition to the natural beauty of Wooster Square Park create a grandiose and stately ambience. The wide streets framed with residential mansions whose doors have opened for commercial usages welcome passersby, creating an inclusive environment. The James English house, now operated by Maresca &amp; Sons funeral home, expertly plays into the theme of converting stately residential villas into commercial use, thereby unifying the inclusive and welcoming narrative of the street.&nbsp;</p>','<p>Originally designed by Henry Austin for James E. English, this building is a prime example of Austin’s shifting aptitude from classical villas to the latest modes of the time: Tudor, Egyptian Revival, High Gothic, and as this building suggests, Italianate (5). Austin’s characteristically rich but restrained detail can easily be pinpointed in the James English House, boasting its exotic fluted floral columns and scalloped cornice molding and creating an overall unified but powerfully simplistic look fitting for English’s career as a master builder and contractor (1).&nbsp;</p><p>In 1920, Maresca &amp; Sons funeral home purchased the building to provide the finest facilities for the families they’ve been serving since 1888 (2). The funeral services has remained a family business for four generations: the current president, Neil R. Rapuano, is the great grandson of the firm’s founder and maintains the service’s tradition of dignified and compassionate service for families going through the grieving process (2). The third-floor annex made by James English allows the funeral home to welcome multiple families in an intimate manner without the burden of overlapping services, echoing the building’s modest and elegant exterior.&nbsp;</p><p>Recently, Maresca &amp; Sons extensively renovated the interior of the building and added a large wing that serves as a new entrance to provide privacy for clients (2). The remodeling of the house made the building handicap accessible, and the interior renovation allowed for unsurpassed comforts for families. President Rapuano, in an effort to preserve the grandeur of the neighborhood, acquired and restored the Willis Bristol Mansion, a stately villa situated next to the James English house (2). The restoration of both of these mansions represents the neighborhoods commitment to the preservation of the rich aesthetic and historic narrative of the district.&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In 1971, Wooster Square Historic District became the first historic district in New Haven, boasting with an impressive repertoire of architecturally distinguished buildings (3). The James English house, along with the buildings such as the Willis Bristol Mansion, were critical in the establishment of the first historic district in New Haven given how well they represent the historic character and aesthetic beauty of the neighborhood.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>','<p>Named after a prominent Revolutionary War general, Wooster Square was converted into a public, green square in the 1820s (3). By the 1850s, the area became a popular neighborhood given the rapid development of historical and fashionably villas. Built in 1845, the James English house was one such house that boosted the value of Wooster Square district, making it more favorable to the socially prominent.&nbsp;</p><p>At the turn of the 20<sup>th</sup>century, however, the rapid increase of industry and the development of the district’s trend to convert these homes to stores for commercial purposes downgraded the social standard of the neighborhood (3, 6).&nbsp;</p><p>Fortunately, this negative spiral did not last long enough for the neighborhood to lose its social prominence. By the efforts of Yale architectural students who campaigned for the restoration of Wooster Park and its surrounding district, as well as the public endorsement of both the social and architectural potential for the district by the New Haven Preservation Trust led to the salvation and development of the stately historic district we have today (3, 6).&nbsp;</p>','<p><span style="background-color: white; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">1.

Incorporated a year after the war’s end, the Winchester Repeating Arms Company was such a force in nineteenth-century New Haven that it sustained an entire working-class neighborhood. Cropping up around the extensive industrial complex designed by Leoni Robinson, the Winchester Triangle survives today as a prime example of 1800s vernacular architecture. The arms-and-ammunition business boomed through the turn of the 20<sup>th</sup>century, with big-name devotees like President Theodore Roosevelt ensuring the popularity of the “rifle that won the West.” Economic triumph translated to community well-being: as Winchester profited from arms sales during both World Wars, civic institutions like the interracial Winchester Rifles basketball team allowed New Haveners to interact across racial boundaries.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite advertisements touting Winchester rifles and shotguns as “extra strong and safe,” however, the Winchester plant followed the trend of urban deindustrialization that would define New Haven and the rest of the Northeast until the end of the 20<sup>th</sup>century. The company’s sales declined—and labor disputes increased—just as New Haven’s African-American population swelled after World War II, leaving black Dixwell residents with fewer jobs near their homes. After years of deterioration, the complex closed down in 2006, leaving a vacant, decaying behemoth at the heart of the city’s northern neighborhoods.&nbsp;</p><p>By the 2010s, however, the Winchester plant had joined in yet another urban trend: the preservation and adaptive reuse of America’s industrial heritage. Incentivized by City Hall, Forest City Residential Group redeveloped some of Winchester’s main buildings into 158 mixed-income lofts. The refurbished complex, Winchester Lofts, attracts residents by emphasizing its industrial past—and its all-too-recent decay. Other sections of the old Winchester Plant have been turned into storefronts and Science Park, a Yale-affiliated tech incubator. Following the example of other adaptive reuse projects (like Ghirardelli Square in San Francisco), the Winchester complex has been transformed from a vacant, dilapidated factory into a commercial and residential hub. With rents reaching over $1,800 a month, however, it’s unclear that the new Winchester can sustain a neighborhood as diverse and working-class as the old.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>');

Set back from the street with a shallow front yard, this traditional Queen Anne home features a 1975 stucco addition, along with other contemporary features, such as the single spherical outdoor light. These create a unique mixture of styles, breaking up the balance and rhythm of the otherwise traditional façade. This significant alteration to the building was most likely done by Wendell Harp – a former owner, resident, and Yale School of Architecture graduate. On the right side of the facade, a stark white oriel window, broken with repeated small slit panes, protrudes above the similarly white, deeply recessed doorway. The left side of the house is composed of brick, laid in both stretcher-bond and basket-weave orientations, with basket-weave delineating the first and second floors. Brick forms the anchoring mass of the house, topped with a gabled, shingled roof sporting paired casement gable windows surrounded by paneled ornament.&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering these two architectural styles, the house is somewhat Frankenstein-esque, with the two styles joined in the middle. With a concrete backyard, 2.5 stories, and a finished basement with a built-in bar, the apartment-style house contains more space than expected from its modest façade. Additionally, a side octagonal bay window added between 1901 and 1911 adds to the deceptive mass of the building.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>','<p>	The building at 26 Lynwood appears confusing—perhaps even out of place—on the quiet, tree-lined street.&nbsp;&nbsp;Its Queen Anne features mesh with the streetscape, while its recent addition sharply contrasts with the other dwellings on the street. Lynwood’s location is both central and secluded. A small street, it feels inviting and private with its paved and tree-lined sidewalks and similarly-sized family homes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet this intimate residential aesthetic is countered by its proximity to one of New Haven’s central shopping districts. While located on a residential street with mixed apartment and private family buildings, it is only one block away from the commercial Broadway scene and Christ Church.</p><p>	Currently, Lynwood is home to an eclectic group of mostly Yale students. A wide variety of students call this street home, with members of varsity sports teams, music groups and religious organizations grouping in the various buildings. In fact, many Yale students feel that Lynwood has become an extension of Yale; while technically off-campus, the street does not feel as such (Foxhall). Additionally, the Jewish Center, Chabad, now dominates a portion of the street and serves as a commanding focal point.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>','<p>The first residents of the building were Erwin Barnes, a railroad clerk, and his wife, Emma. While the surrounding area was inhabited mostly by those who worked in the carriage industry, Lynwood was home to a slightly wealthier group of urban residents, including the Barneses.&nbsp;&nbsp;As Gilchrist says in her nomination of Dwight Street area as a historic place,&nbsp;“Lynwood Place became a fashionable enclave of expensively built, brick dwellings and townhouses designed to comply with new city fire laws.” Lynwood was an enclave within the larger working-class neighborhood of Dwight Street. Following Erwin’s death in the late 1920s, the building was changed from a single-family home to an apartment building, with various tenants residing in it until the 1970s, when it became largely vacant. This shift to a multi-tenant dwelling was precipitated by the increased population of New Haven during the interwar period in the 1930s.&nbsp;</p><p>Wendell Harp bought it in 1973. A Yale graduate, Harp was the youngest registered architect in the city, and was married to Toni Harp, who became New Haven\'s first African-American female mayor in 2014. Harp most likely designed and built the prominent white stucco addition to the home. Mr. Harp died in 2011; Mayor Harp no longer lives there. The structure is now occupied by members of the Yale Men’s Lightweight Crew Team, which hosts social events open to the Yale student body.</p><p>Through its 133 years, 26 Lynwood chronicles the tale of this working-class neighborhood and the spread of Yale’s campus. Its history shows the rise of urban residential spaces within New Haven.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>','<p>Before 1820, the surrounding area stood as a piece of undeveloped, forested land on Yale’s Western edge.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, with the rise in American industry following the war of 1812, it quickly became developed and settled -&nbsp;&nbsp;mostly during the 1820s.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was during this time that carriage shops dominated the Dwight Street district, with multiple shops lining Park Street, the street parallel to Lynwood. Investors rushed to purchase the land to sell to employees of the various carriage companies.</p><p>Post–Civil War growth greatly increased New Haven’s population and led to the increase of multifamily homes in residential areas—as evidenced by the entirety of Lynwood Place. The first building to be built on the plot of land at 26 Lynwood was the current structure still standing. The land was bought from Hooker and Osbourne by Erwin Barnes, the structure’s first resident.&nbsp;</p>','<p><em>Foxhall, Emily.

The presence of Marlin Firearms Co. a block over, however, already suggested that this area, a sliver of the East Rock neighborhood by a bend in the Mill River, would be much more industrial than residential. Indeed, after a short-lived subdivision hinting at possible housing construction, the Foster Street lot was reassembled to its original size, purchased by the New Haven Machine Screw Company, and given industrial purpose with the creation of the screw factory. In time, the Rockbestos rope manufacturing plant would abut the expanding Marlin property, cementing the neighborhood’s industrial character.&nbsp;</span></p>','<p>Originally constructed for the New Haven Machine Screw Company in 1912, this two-story, reinforced concrete structure housed Lehman Brothers Inc., a commercial printing firm, for most of its existence. Between 1929, when Louis and Isadore Lehman relocated their engraving business to the Foster Street plant, and 2008, when Eric Lehman closed the factory’s doors for the last time, Lehman Brothers produced specialty engravings and fine stationery using one of the oldest (and largest) engraving machines in the United States (Bailey, 2008). In the summer, the company would open the modernist building’s massive windows, allowing natural light to stream in and engraving sounds to spill out into the East Rock neighborhood (Bailey, 2008). </p><p>After the business succumbed to bankruptcy, its complex, composed of the original printing press building, a one-story warehouse, and a steel Quonset hut, sat vacant for ten years, providing shelter for squatters and entertainment for urban explorers. Various efforts to rehabilitate the rapidly deteriorating property fell through, until developer Ocean Management purchased the buildings for $700,000 in 2017, with detailed plans to transform 191, 197, and 199 Foster Street into condominiums (O’Leary, 2018). The redevelopment, currently underway, entails the renovation of the 1912 structure, the demolition of the warehouse and Quonset hut, and the construction of six townhouses and a Bauhaus midrise. Once on the market in 2019, the Foster Street project will test whether New Haven’s housing boom—typified by other adaptive reuse developments, such as Winchester Lofts and Strouse Adler Apartments—can sustain $400,000 condos alongside high-end rentals (Breen, 2017).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>','<p>Despite its poor condition, 191 Foster is a prime example of early modern American architecture, constructed before the World Wars brought over dozens of notable European modernists. Like many of the twentieth-century factories that would follow, the printing press building is made of reinforced concrete, molded into a long rectangle and punctuated by spacious window openings. As Chester L. Lucas wrote when the New Haven Machine Screw Company moved into the 10,000-square-foot space, “[I]n designing the building, special attention was given to the lighting system; as may be seen, almost all of the wall space is taken up by windows” (Lucas, 1912). Though the current owner, Ocean Management, has boarded up the windows, pre-renovation photographs reveal that natural light once streamed into the plant’s long workspaces, which were (and are) subdivided only by slender concrete columns. Such an open floor plan allowed the screw company—and, later, Lehman Brothers—to lay out assembly lines that ensured swift production. The ca. 1940 additions to the complex are similarly spacious, yet lack the linearity and efficiency of the original structure. For instance, the concrete brick warehouse is much wider, meaning its thin windows fail to fully light the space. Meanwhile, the steel Quonset hut, tucked between two wings of the warehouse, is semicircular rather than rectilinear—its curved ceiling rises out of the otherwise flat roof. Lehman Brothers increased the hut’s square footage by constructing a wooden loft inside the traditional half-moon design.&nbsp;</p><p>The entire plant shows signs of both deterioration and rehabilitation. Insulation hangs from the ceiling inside the warehouse, reaching down toward the splintered remains of the hut’s loft, destroyed and strewn about the floor in the first stages of redevelopment. The hut itself is off-limits—plastic sheets with asbestos warnings fend off any curious explorers. Many of the vines and weeds that used to climb the exterior of the abandoned printing building were removed along with its distinctive, stark-white paint; the factory and warehouse are now a dull gray, darkening the otherwise vibrant streetscape. Although some graffiti has been painted over, white spray paint still instructs visitors in the main hall to “Leave Now”—a message that Ocean Management probably doesn’t mind communicating to anyone sneaking onto the site.</p><p>The architect in charge of redevelopment, Wayne Garrick, once described the printing press building as Bauhaus, a strain of modernism pioneered by Walter Gropius in Weimar Germany (Breen, 2017). Garrick’s characterization must be retroactive, however: Gropius didn’t found the Bauhaus school until 1919, seven years after 191 Foster was built. Nevertheless, the structure does recall Gropius’s Chicago Tribune Tower design, streamlined for industrial purposes. Moreover, the building and its history hint at the dichotomy between modernism’s original ideals and its eventual implementation in the United States. European modernists often espoused fairly liberal ideas—the Nazis justified shutting down the Bauhaus by claiming it promoted communist thought. Yet American corporations and manufacturers, from General Motors down to the New Haven Machine Screw Company, would adorn their skyscrapers and factories with modernist touches like spacious windows and concrete walls, thereby associating modernism with the men in charge of the economy. Lehman Brothers’ workers experienced this contradiction firsthand when the company, facing bankruptcy, failed to pay them $180,000 in wages and benefits (Bailey, 2010).</p>','<p>The Lehman Brothers plant straddles the border between East Rock’s vanishing industrial sector and the rest of the comfortably residential neighborhood. To the east lie brick manufacturing complexes, once home to a rope foundry and gun maker, now renovated into retail and office spaces. To the west, East Rock’s trademark 2.5- and 3-story homes, with their tiny yards, elaborate porches, and varied color schemes, grant the neighborhood an almost suburban character. A half-mile away, East Rock itself rises into the sky, promising potential tenants of Ocean Management’s condo complex “amazing views” of the ruddy cliff (O’Leary, 2011).&nbsp;</p>','<p>Founded in 1911 with John J. Reidy at the helm, the New Haven Machine Screw Company commissioned its Foster Street plant in 1912, possibly from local architect Philip Sellers (O’Leary, 2011). With $75,000 in capital at their disposal, the company constructed a modest, 10,000-square-foot factory on land formerly owned by the B. Foster estate (Businesses, 1913-1998; City Atlas, 1911). Though its size paled in comparison to the Marlin Firearms building across the street, or to the Winchester Repeating Arms complex farther west, 191 Foster had something those more established enterprises did not: a fireproof, reinforced concrete design that heralded the coming age of industrial modernism. Its long, open floor plan accommodated Machine Screw’s lengthy turret lathe machines, which molded low-carbon steel into rough-hewn screws. Advertised as “Foster safety steel-set screws,” the company’s products found their way into countless industrial machines across the region (Lucas, 1912). Nonetheless, the screw company went into receivership three years after opening. Lewis G. Richardson, who took charge of the business’s assets, managed to drastically improve its fortunes. By 1916, Richardson had hired 60-65 “expert workmen” and solicited orders for “several million spark plugs” to diversify production (Hill, 1918).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The New Haven Machine Screw Company’s fate after 1916 is unknown. By 1929, Lehman Brothers Inc. moved into the Foster Street factory, substituting automatic printing and engraving machines for the screw-making assembly line. Having established themselves as a firm with “a very large clientele” and “a host of friends throughout New England” from their original location on Court Street, the printing shop thrived on Foster, at least after the Great Depression (<em>Walden’s Stationer</em>, 1919). In the 1940s, they expanded the plant to 25,000 square feet by building a Quonset hut and one-story warehouse, additions that allowed the company to meet demand for products like specialty wedding invitations and engraved White House stationery (Bailey, 2008; O’Leary, 2011). Running the machines were many long-term workers, men and women who spent decades accumulating technical knowledge not easily transferable to other trades. The din of engraving machines spilled out into the otherwise residential East Rock neighborhood when the company opened its windows in the summer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps due to their small scale, Lehman Brothers survived longer than many other New Haven industries; by 2004, however, union healthcare costs and competition from electronic printers drove the firm into bankruptcy (Bailey, 2008). On December 9<sup>th</sup>, 2008, a court-appointed bankruptcy trustee named Michael Daly arrived at the plant, ordered its workers and owners to leave, and changed the locks. The firm’s executives—many of them descendants of the founding Lehman brothers—moved to a Connecticut firm that purchased the company’s brand and products; the workers, meanwhile, were told to seek $180,000 worth of unpaid wages, benefits, and severance pay in bankruptcy court. With thirty-plus years of experience in an obsolete trade, seventeen former employees did exactly that, attempting to capture some of the $1-10 million Lehman owed its creditors (Bailey, 2008; Bailey, 2010).&nbsp;</p><p>The decade-long struggle to renovate this out-of-place factory on Foster Street began almost as soon as Lehman went under. Peter de Bretteville, a Yale architecture professor from Hamden, drew up plans to convert the printing press building, with its “robust concrete frame,”&nbsp;&nbsp;into an apartment complex (Bailey, 2009). He quickly became the site’s preferred bidder, though his bid decreased considerably after an environmental study revealed the land would need to be decontaminated before any construction could start. Two years after Lehman folded, a little known Israeli-American developer named Gil Marshak outbid de Bretteville and several other buyers, purchasing the site for $505,000. His real estate company, RBFH (Rebuilding Fair Haven) LLC, failed to do anything with the property for years, despite the cooperation of partners like historic preservationist Alek Juskevice, who wanted to “bring vibrancy” to a part of East Rock “that’s sort of vacant and dead” (Bailey, 2010). Little occurred between 2010 and 2017. Vines obscured the factory’s white concrete walls. Its windows shattered. Michael Daly, the firm’s bankruptcy trustee, went to federal prison for embezzling $11,000 from the Lehman Brothers estate. Urban explorers like Philip Damico made YouTube videos marveling at the structure’s decay.&nbsp;</p><p>Then Ocean Management purchased the property in 2017 for $200,000 more than Marshak had paid (O’Leary, 2018). Owned by Israeli investor Shmuel Aizenberg and run by New Haven native Mendy Paris, Ocean Management had spent the last three years buying up run-down properties in the city; by the time it bought the Lehman factory, it already owned 900 apartments. In this case, the firm wanted to “transform a vacant and unused industrial plant and reintegrate the property into the East Rock neighborhood” (Peak, 2018). It plans to do so by spending $8-10 million testing whether New Haveners will buy condominiums rather than renting luxury apartments. Now in its initial stages, the construction plans call for the demolition of the warehouse, the Quonset hut, and an abandoned two-story home on the property. Deemed more historically significant, the 1912 printing press building will remain standing, rechristened as a condominium complex with six two-bedroom, 1,500 square-feet units. On one side, separated by a row of trees, six Greek Revival townhouses will rise up, reweaving the site into East Rock’s urban fabric. On the other, a four-story, synthetic stucco Bauhaus midrise will accentuate the development’s modernist feel. Condos will sell for around $400,000 (Breen, 2017).</p><p>The development’s success is up in the air, and will be until it opens in mid-2019. Yet a good number of residents are excited about it. Kevin McCarthy attended a community meeting where Ocean Management explained its plans. “This is the first time that a development has met with applause at a meeting,” he said (Breen, 2017). In June 2018, the city’s zoning board approved the project despite its high density, which can only legally occur when the development shows “such unusual merit as to reflect credit upon the developer and upon the city” (Peak, 2018).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>');

','2','<p>This building’s simple structure lends it a versatility of function. It currently houses two organizations and, in a sense, has two separate identities.</p><p>From the Whitney Avenue side, this building is unassuming. The broad, brick, and largely unadorned exterior—in combination with the horizontality of the windows lining its second floor—make the eye of the casual passerby glide right by it. Anyone who takes second glance will appreciate the pleasant retail space of Katahdin Furniture. The first floor’s long and large windows, pressed up against the sidewalk, display shiny toys and kitchenware. This modest showiness helps the building fit in with the neighboring stores: a Dunkin’ Donuts and Katalina’s (a bakery) among others.&nbsp;</p><p>From the Temple Street side, this building is bold. A fantastical mural covers the entire brick exterior. The verticality and vivacity of the mural counteract the horizontality of the windows and general shape of the building to create a memorable impression. On this side, the building houses Yale’s Office of International Students &amp; Scholars (OISS). A glassy entrance and bright yellow railing, in combination with the mural, make a fun welcome for the Yale students and faculty and New Haven residents who visit the building. Ironically, the building’s distance from the street (a small parking lot acts as a buffer) in comparison to the neighboring buildings helps it “pop out.”&nbsp;</p>','<p>This is a two-story modernist building, composed primarily of brick, with flat, plain exterior walls and a flat tar roof.</p><p>On the Whitney Avenue side, two large windows on the bottom serve as display cases for Katahdin Furniture, while the row of six smaller windows on the second floor give light to that office space. The blue awning covering the door of Katahdin furniture and small trees lining the sidewalk add modest personality to this side of the building. The interior of Katahdin Furniture has a part-wood-part-linoleum floor and white walls, with a Doric column that adds a small flair of neoclassicism (3a).</p><p>From the Temple Street side, the building has a similar array windows, yet without the two large display ones on the first floor. The mural depicts stretched out quarters of the globe. Its main colors are blue and orange, complementary colors that make the mural’s active design particularly vibrant. A large, boxy entrance protrudes from the flat exterior, and is slightly raised on a cement base, with stairs that connect the entrance platform to the small parking lot in-between the building and the street. The combination of the gaudy mural and the metallic, glassy entrance lend this side of the building a hodgepodge, slightly postmodern look. The interior of the building is a modern yet comfortable office space (9a, 10a).</p>','<p>On the Whitney Avenue side, the building makes a nice addition to slew of stores and office spaces in the tightly packed Whitney-Audubon area that service Yale and the greater East Rock and New Haven community. Its flat, brick exterior, which hugs the sidewalk, matches that of the surrounding buildings. On the Temple Street side, the building’s adornments make it stand out from the surrounding buildings. However, it and its neighbors are united in their purpose of serving Yale. An alleyway south of the building serves as a passageway for students to travel back-and-forth between Temple Street and Whitney Avenue—or between Yale and New Haven (29).&nbsp;</p>','<p>The fact that this simple building has had three addresses is emblematic of the building’s rich and varied history. In the early 1900s, this building belonged to the estate of the (presumably) wealthy Emily Bushnell while still being a home for working-class Charles O’Connell, a piano teacher and mechanic (2, 3, 4, 5, 23). After becoming a commercial space in the mid 1900s, the building has housed a garage—an every-man, economy business—and a piano store—a high-end business.</p><p>In some ways, the building has become an extension of Yale’s campus. After all, it is a Yale-owned building and OISS essentially serves as a “living room” for the international students living in the graduate student housing across the street, at 420 Temple Street (29). However, the building also serves as a point connection between Yale and New Haven. Not only does it house a retail store as well as university offices, but it also literally connects Yale students to the New Haven community through an alleyway south of the building, which students often travel through to visit the shops and stores in the Whitney-Audubon area (29). OISS also hosts programming in the building that engages the local community and works with international organizations such as IRIS. On a larger scale, the building currently acts as a link between Yale and New Haven and the world through its engagement with the international community.</p><p>Notably, the building does seem to have lost its connection with the working class—the Charles O’Connells of the world—in spite of its work with IRIS and other community organizations. The gentrification of the Whitney-Audubon area and of the area surrounding Yale has probably contributed to this shift.</p>','<p>Few documents with information about the beginning of this site could be found, but 1888 and 1879 maps show buildings at 58 and 60 Whitney Avenue, and the New Haven Assessor’s Database reports that 58 Whitney Avenue was built in 1900 (24, 26, 8b).</p><p>As of 1911, the Emily Bushnell Estate included most of the property in between Temple Street and Whitney Avenue, including the buildings at 58 and 60 Whitney Avenue, both of which were likely houses (Information has yet to be uncovered regarding Emily Bushnell’s identity) (23). Except for a change in ownership around the year 1933, this estate owned 58 and 60 Whitney Avenue at least until 1935 (1b, 2b). Records suggest that Henry V Brothers lived at 58 Whitney Avenue as a tenant in 1914 (1). Then, Charles H O’Connell, a mechanic (potentially at the neighboring New Haven Manufacturing Company) and music teacher, lived as a tenant at 58 Whitney from 1915 to 1919 (2, 3, 4, 5, 23). Charles E Falkner lived at 58 Whitney Avenue in 1920 (6).&nbsp;</p><p>In 1922, while the properties still belonged to the Bushnell Estate, 58 and 60 Whitney Avenue were converted into a single, one-story brick garage registered at 58 Whitney Avenue that would be used as a commercial space—in parallel with the development and commercialization of other plots of land between Whitney Avenue and Temple Street (8, 3b, 7b). Several garage-based businesses inhabited the space from 1922 until 1948, including Rent A Ford Co., University Garage, The Timken-Detroit Co, and Whitney Avenue Garage (7, 8, 10). For this period, the building seemed to have provided a staple service to automobile owners in the Whitney-Audubon area (9b).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The building had come under the ownership of the Connecticut Housing Corporation by 1948. In that year, the Corporation converted the garage into a two-story office building and commercial space.</p><p>As of 1960, Clinton’s Pianos (previously Clinton’s Inc. Pianos) had come to inhabit spaces on the first and second floors of 60 Whitney Avenue (14). Other businesses had smaller offices in the 58 Whitney Avenue part of the building between 1960 and 2001 (14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21). However, in 2001, Clinton’s Pianos became the sole inhabitant of the building. In 2005, it was discovered that the owner of Clinton’s Pianos was using the business, which had retail stores in several cities apart from New Haven, to participate in a $3 million scam (27, 28). Presumably, the business was shut down.</p><p>Yale had taken ownership of the building by 1994, so when Clinton’s Pianos was shut down in 2005, Yale moved its Office of International Students &amp; Scholars (OISS), previously called the Yale International Center, to the building (29, 4b, 5b). The entrance to these offices was placed in what had been the back of the building, which was designated as 421 Temple Street, possibly so that it would be facing campus and the graduate student housing across the street (29). OISS still exists at that same address. In 2005, Yale also let a new business come into 60 Whitney Avenue: the furniture store Katahdin Furniture (6b).&nbsp;</p>','<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>New Haven Directory</em>&nbsp;(New Haven: Price &amp; Lee Co., 1914)</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>New Haven Directory</em>&nbsp;(New Haven: Price &amp; Lee Co., 1915)</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>New Haven Directory</em>&nbsp;(New Haven: Price &amp; Lee Co., 1917)</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>New Haven Directory</em>&nbsp;(New Haven: Price &amp; Lee Co., 1918)</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>New Haven Directory</em>&nbsp;(New Haven: Price &amp; Lee Co., 1919)</p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>New Haven Directory</em>&nbsp;(New Haven: Price &amp; Lee Co., 1920)</p><p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>New Haven Directory</em>&nbsp;(New Haven: Price &amp; Lee Co., 1924-1925)</p><p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>New Haven Directory</em>&nbsp;(New Haven: Price &amp; Lee Co., 1930)</p><p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>New Haven Directory</em>&nbsp;(New Haven: Price &amp; Lee Co., 1935)</p><p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>New Haven Directory</em>&nbsp;(New Haven: Price &amp; Lee Co., 1941)</p><p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>New Haven Directory</em>&nbsp;(New Haven: Price &amp; Lee Co., 1944-1945)</p><p>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>New Haven Directory</em>&nbsp;(New Haven: Price &amp; Lee Co., 1950)</p><p>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>New Haven Directory</em>&nbsp;(New Haven: Price &amp; Lee Co., 1955)</p><p>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>New Haven Directory</em>&nbsp;(New Haven: Price &amp; Lee Co., 1960)</p><p>15.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>New Haven Directory</em>&nbsp;(New Haven: Price &amp; Lee Co., 1965)</p><p>16.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>New Haven Directory</em>&nbsp;(New Haven: Price &amp; Lee Co., 1970)</p><p>17.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>New Haven Directory</em>&nbsp;(New Haven: Price &amp; Lee Co., 1980)</p><p>18.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>New Haven Directory</em>&nbsp;(New Haven: Price &amp; Lee Co., 1985)</p><p>19.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>New Haven Directory</em>&nbsp;(New Haven: Price &amp; Lee Co., 1990)</p><p>20.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>New Haven Directory</em>&nbsp;(New Haven: Price &amp; Lee Co., 1995)</p><p>21.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>New Haven Directory</em>&nbsp;(New Haven: Price &amp; Lee Co., 2001)</p><p>22.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bailey, O.H. and J.C.

York 220 is made of three different, red bricked structures united in the shape of an ‘L’: on the left is a large building with a gothic window and a gable roof; in the middle, a lower, squarer structure with a flat roof; and towards the right, another small, gable -roofed building, protruding from the middle section. There is an embellished main entrance, an accessibility ramp and a bike rack, as well as a second entrance that leads straight into York 220’s ‘Ballroom’: a fairly large performance and rehearsal space. Originally built for Psi Upsilon, which later became the Fence Club, York 220 was bought by Yale University and adapted in the 1980s to serve Yale Students. It is now occupied by the Yale University’s Theatre Studies Department and functions as a multi purpose space for many students pursuing theatre at Yale. Along with housing Theatre Studies offices, classes and lectures, York 220 is a space for students to rehearse, host auditions, and perform.</p>','3','100\' x 85\'','<p>1928: Psi Upsilon Beta Chapter -- Student Society Hall</p><p>1934: The Fence Club (Psi Upsilon post-disaffiliation) -- Student Society Hall</p><p>1979- 1986: Yale University -- multi purpose space for the Architecture department, Theatre Studies department, and theatre students and organisations.</p><p>1987 - Now: Yale University Theatre Studies Department</p>','<p>York 220 is a 3- part structured building, styled as a hybrid of Collegiate Gothic, Greek Revival and Tudor Revival architecture. Indeed, there have been almost no renovations to the building’s exterior since its erection in 1928, even though its interiors have been entirely redone and repurposed.</p><p>York 220 is an L-shaped structure with 3 distinct sections. The first section is a tall, rectangular mass on south end, which has a 3-bay facade with small, narrow windows. The second story and third story bays are separated by short projecting buttresses. In the center of this section, on the first story, is a large octagonal bay window with arched lights and stone mullions. In front of the facade is a “well” which exposes the basement windows: the windows are arched, and the center window is decoratively cut within the stone base of the bay window above. The well is bordered with an iron spike fence. The chimney has two corbeled, octagonal brick stacks. On the left side of this section is another entrance to the building, through a kind of “gate”, with original drip molding and decorative gutter heads. In the middle of the building there is yet another entrance, used mainly in the case of a fire, up a small staircase which leads into the “Ballroom”. (1)</p><p>The second section has flat roof with a stone trimmed, crenelated parapet. There are rectangular 3-part windows on both the first and second story, with stone quoining and drip molding. On this section is also an elaborate arched entrance, with a hybrid Greek revival pediments. Here there are three small statues: an owl in the centre and a column on either side. In the centre of the pediment originally stood the Fraternity Psi Upsilon’s coat-of-arms, which has now been sanded or erased for the building’s current use, leaving an blank symbol. Additionally, the buildings has an accessibility ramp and bike rack in front of its main entrance, added in 1988, after the building was assumed by the Yale Theatre Studies Department, in order to comply by accessibility regulations.</p><p>Finally, the third section protrudes out of the centre section, moving northwards into the driveway. It has two rectangular window panels with stone quoining and drip molding on its west facing side, and a small, high up rectangular window on its north, street-facing side.&nbsp;</p><p>The basement of York 220 opens into a small, concrete patio (also accessible from a front gate), with a staircase that goes up to the second level. This second level walkway forms an awning over the patio, underneath which are benches and a statue.</p><p>Many of the dorm rooms, the library, and the basement (originally a large and open dining hall) were modified into classrooms and small lecture rooms. Some luxurious components of the house, such as marble bathrooms and showers, were removed entirely. The Fence Club’s main lounge was modified into York 220’s “Ballroom”: a performance and rehearsal space. The only thing that remained intact was the original “council room” or “chapter room” on the second floor, with brown wooden walls and seats, appearing almost as a courtroom, which was used for meetings. The doors that originally opened from the council room into the library are still there, however they are not unopenable and have walls behind them. The original plans show how the seats intend to open, and there are “concealed doors” behind them. This feature is still intact: it is possible to climb under the seats and stand in the wall behind the chapter room, however, these days, there is nowhere to go from there.</p>','<p>York 220 is surrounded by Yale- owned buildings, situated next to the University Theatre, and surrounded by buildings such as the African American Cultural House and the Yale Cabaret -- all built in the same period by James Gamble Rogers, sharing a stylistic cohesiveness. However, since all these buildings are spread in a driveway section between York Street and Park Street, they are only partially visible, creating a sense of secrecy and privacy. This is likely to have been an intentional choice, since all these buildings were originally intended for Fraternities and Societies. Wolf’s Head, the Secret Society building, partially conceals York 220, adding to the sense of privacy which juxtaposes York 220’s current purpose as an institutional facility for Yale</p><p>students.</p>','<p>The social history of York 220 parallels the social history of Yale itself: the evolutions of its student body, the students body’s relationship to Yale as an institution, and the way Yale claims and changes the architectural space of New Haven.</p><p>York 220 was originally built for the Psi Upsilon Beta Chapter, a Junior Fraternity, established in 1839.(2) It was an elite organisation, with the aim of grabbing the best and brightest undergraduates. The building plans and interior design choices demonstrate this. Images of the central lounge, for example, reveal lush furniture, a Tudor-esque stage with a piano, and Greek revival interior design within: statues and columns are thinly built into the walls, as a kind of&nbsp;decoration. The third section of York 220, the smallest, and most simple section of the structure, was originally intended to be the “servant quarter” (3), which housed live in servants to cook and clean. However, Psi Upsilon was slowly losing money due to the introduction of Residential Colleges at Yale. The fact that Residential Colleges required students to eat various meals a week in their college reduced the necessity of Fraternities in general. Psi Upsilon shut down in 1934 (4), a year after Pierson and Davenport College were built, two colleges just a short walk down York Street.</p><p>However, the men of Psi Upsilon immediately opened The Fence Club to replace the Fraternity: a disaffiliated version of Psi Upsilon, which still lived in York 220 (then also known as 204 York and 224 York), alleviated of payment to the national chapter. The Fence Club still maintained its status as an exclusive organisation, adopting a “a rush process” similar to other fraternities. In the 1940s and ’50s, Fence Club began housing huge parties, and occasionally hiring entire orchestras to perform.(5) The Fence Club, however, was known among the University for being the Fraternity with the lowest performing academic record.(6) One student, Muntz Baldwin, was in fact found to be using Fence Club as the location for his gambling game, and was arrested.(7) The</p><p>Fence Club in York 220 set itself up in contrast to the Yale Buildings emerging all over Campus and into New Haven: a party space, or an “escape” from the traditional or formal obligations of Yale as an academic institution.</p><p>However, the political climate of the 1960s and 1970s pushed people away from Fraternities, and their emphasis on exclusivity. Fence’s membership plummeted, and they decided to welcome women into the fraternity in 1972.(8) Fence was radically trying to change its image from an elite drinking club to a familiar, welcoming home for all: anyone could now enter the house, however, not everyone could become a member. Fence was still struggling to keep up with its debts (9), despite increasing membership, and closed in September, 1979.(10) In some sense, Fence could not change at the same pace that Yale was changing, in terms of politics, academic mentality and inclusivity.</p><p>However, Yale University assumed ownership over the building instead. Between 1979 and 1986, the building became a multi purpose space for Architecture students, the Theatre Studies department, and drama students and organisations. Since the space naturally suited use for Theatre students and organisations, based on its large, stage spaces, the University planned to adapt it to be used by performance groups. In 1986, the architect Peter Millard was hired by Yale to renovate the interior of York 220 to fit the needs of Yale’s Theatre Studies Department, and in 1987, York 220 became under their control.(11) Today it remains the Theatre Studies Department building, and a rehearsal space for organisations like the DRAMAT, Control Group, and other students under the Yale Drama Coalition.</p>','<p>The Sanborn maps from 1886 and 1911 show that the area of land where York 220 now stands was occupied by one or two residential buildings. Although nothing was torn down to accommodate the building of York 220 specifically, much of the area of York Street between Library Walk and Chapel Street was used to build exclusively Yale Buildings over time (at the expense of New Haven residences). York 220 was built at the same time as other Fraternity houses, in the late 1920s and early 1920s, to establish “Fraternity Row”. At the time, the only Yale buildings in that area was the original School of Medicine and the University Theatre.</p><p>James Gamble Rogers used Collegiate Gothic and Tudor revival styles in order “to create a patch of village scenery in the midst of an urban grid”(12), creating a kind of rural and enchanting atmosphere for the fraternity houses. At the same time, his choice to adopt Architectural styles from Oxford and Cambridge reminded onlookers of the elitism and prestige of these buildings and those who occupied them.</p><p>The Fence Club was not the only society or Fraternity assumed by Yale University. All the buildings in this section of York Street, apart from Wolf’s Head, were bought and renovated to accommodate different Yale programs. Alongside Fence, renovated to suit the Theatre Studies Department, stand the Yale Cabaret and several Cultural Houses.</p>','<p>Brown, Elizabeth Mills.
